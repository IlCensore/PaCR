 and many still believe, that in ancient Rome the doctrines of Christ found
 no proselytes, except among the lower and poorer classes of citizens.
 That is certainly a noble picture which represents the new faith as searching
 among the haunts of poverty and slavery, seeking to inspire faith, hope,
 and charity in their occupants; to transform them from things into human
 beings; to make them believe in the happiness of a future life; to alleviate
 their present sufferings; to redeem their children from shame and servitude;
 to proclaim them equal to their masters.
 But the gospel found its way also to the mansions of the masters, nay,
 even to the palace of the Caesars.
 The discoveries lately made on this subject are startling, and constitute
 a new chapter in the history of imperial Rome.
 We have been used to consider early Christian history and primitive Christian
 art as matters of secondary importance, and hardly worthy the attention
 of the classical student.
 Thus, none of the four or five hundred volumes on the topography of ancient
 Rome speaks of the basilicas raised by Constantine; of the church of S.
 Maria Antiqua, built side by side with the Temple of Vesta, the two worships
 dwelling together as it were, for nearly a century; of the Christian burial-gro
unds; of the imperial mausoleum near S.
 Peter's; of the porticoes, several miles in length, which led from the
 centre of the city to the churches of S.
 Peter, S.
 Paul, and S.
 Lorenzo; of the palace of the Caesars transformed into the residence of
 the Popes.
 Why should these constructions of monumental and historical character be
 expelled from the list of classical buildings? and why should we overlook
 the fact that many great names in the annals of the empire are those of
 members of the Church, especially when the knowledge of their conversion
 enables us to explain events that had been, up to the latest discoveries,
 shrouded in mystery?

\begin_layout Standard
It is a remarkable fact that the record of some of these events should be
 found, not in church annals, calendars, or itineraries, but in passages
 in the writings of pagan annalists and historians.
 Thus, in ecclesiastical documents no mention is made of the conversion
 of the two Domitillae, or Flavius Clemens, or Petronilla, all of whom were
 relatives of the Flavian emperors; and of the Acilii Glabriones, the noblest
 among the noble, as Herodianus calls them (2.3).
 Their fortunes and death are described only by the Roman historians and
 biographers of the time of Domitian.
 It seems that when the official

, or calendar, was resumed, after the end of the persecutions, preference
 was given to names of those confessors and martyrs whose deeds were still
 fresh in the memory of the living, and of necessity little attention was
 paid to those of the first and second centuries, whose acts either had
 not been written down, or had been lost during the persecutions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As the crypt of the Acilii Glabriones on the Via Salaria has become one
 of the chief places of attraction, since its re-discovery in 1888, I cannot
 begin this volume under better auspices than by giving an account of this
 important event.

In exploring that portion of the Catacombs of Priscilla which lies under
 the Monte delle Gioie, near the entrance from the Via Salaria, de Rossi

 The desire of finding the name and the history of the first occupants of
 this noble tomb, whose memory seems to have been so dear to the faithful,
 led the explorers to carefully sift the earth which filled the place; and
 their pains were rewarded by the discovery of a fragment of a marble coffin,
 inscribed with the letters:

 discoveries; four inscriptions, naming Manius Acilius \SpecialChar \ldots{}

 when Acilius Glabrio, consul in 563 (

 191), conquered the Macedonians at the battle of Thermopylae.
 We have in Rome two records of his career: the Temple of Piety, erected
 by him on the west side of the Forum Olitorium, now transformed into the
 church of S.
 Nicola in Carcere; and the pedestal of the equestrian statue, of gilt bronze,
 offered to him by his son, the first of its kind ever seen in Italy, which
 was discovered by Valadier in 1808, at the foot of the steps of the temple,
 and buried again.
 Towards the end of the republic we find them established on the Pincian
 Hill, where they had built a palace and laid out gardens which extended
 at least from the convent of the Trinità dei Monti to the Villa Borghese.

 Other details of Glabrio's fate are given by Dion Cassius, Juvenal, and
 Fronto.
 We are told by these authors that during his consulship,

 91, and before his banishment, he was compelled by Domitian to fight against
 a lion and two bears in the amphitheatre adjoining the emperor's villa
 at Albanum.
 The event created such an impression in Rome, and its memory lasted so
 long that, half a century later, we find it given by Fronto as a subject
 for rhetorical composition to his pupil Marcus Aurelius.
 The amphitheatre is still in existence, and was excavated in 1887.
 Like the one at Tusculum, it is partly hollowed out of the rocky side of
 the mountain, partly built of stone and rubble work.
 It well deserves a visit from the student and the tourist, on account of
 its historical associations, and of the admirable view which its ruins
 command of the vine-clad slopes of Albano and Castel Savello, the wooded
 plains of Ardea and Lavinium, the coast of the Tyrrhenian, and the islands

 that is, the Christian faith.
 Manius Acilius Glabrio, the ex-consul, was implicated in the same trial,
 and condemned on the same indictment with the others.
 Among these the historian mentions Clemens and Domitilla, who were manifestly
 Christians.
 One particular of the case, related by Juvenal, confirms the account of
 Xiphilinus.
 He says that in order to mitigate the wrath of the emperor and avoid a
 catastrophe, Acilius Glabrio, after fighting the wild beasts at Albanum,
 assumed an air of stupidity.
 In this alleged stupidity it is easy to recognize the prejudice so common
 among the pagans, to whom the Christians' retirement from the joys of the
 world, their contempt of public honors, and their modest behavior appeared
 as 
\begin_inset ERT

Glabrio was put to death in his place of exile, the name of which is not

 His end helped, no doubt, the propagation of the gospel among his relatives
 and descendants, as well as among the servants and freedmen of the house,
 as shown by the noble sarcophagi and the humbler loculi found in such numbers
 in the crypt of the Catacombs of Priscilla.
 The small oratory at the southern end of the crypt seems to have been consecrat
ed exclusively to the memory of its first occupant, the ex-consul.
 The date and the circumstances connected with the translation of his relics
 from the place of banishment to Rome are not known.

Both the chapel and the crypt were found in a state of devastation hardly
 credible, as though the plunderers had taken pleasure in satisfying their
 vandalic instincts to the utmost.
 Each of the sarcophagi was broken into a hundred pieces; the mosaics of
 the walls and the ceiling had been wrenched from their sockets, cube by
 cube, the marble incrustations torn off, the altar dismantled, the bones
 dispersed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When did this wholesale destruction take place? In times much nearer ours
 than the reader may imagine.
 I have been able to ascertain the date, with the help of an anecdote related
 by Pietro Sante Bartoli in § 144 of his archaeological memoirs: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Excavations were made under Innocent

 (1667--1670), in the Monte delle Gioie, on the Via Salaria, with the hope
 of discovering a certain hidden treasure.
 The hope was frustrated; but, deep in the bowels of the mound, some crypts
 were found, encrusted with white stucco, and remarkable for their neatness
 and preservation.
 I have heard from trustworthy men that the place is haunted by spirits,
 as is proved by what happened to them not many months ago.
 While assembled on the Monte delle Gioie for a picnic, the conversation
 turned upon the ghosts who haunted the crypt below, when suddenly the carriage
 which had brought them there, pushed by invisible hands, began to roll
 down the slope of the hill, and was ultimately precipitated into the river
 Anio at its base.
 Several oxen had to be used to haul the vehicle out of the stream.
 This happened to Tabarrino, butcher at S.
 Eustachio, and to his brothers living in the Via Due Macelli, whose faces
 still bear marks of the great terror experienced that day.

There is no doubt that the anecdote refers to the tomb of the Acilii Glabriones,
 which is cut under the Monte delle Gioie, and is the only one in the Catacombs
 of Priscilla remarkable for a coating of white stucco.
 Its destruction, therefore, took place under Clement

, and was the work of treasure-hunters.
 And the very nature of clandestine excavations, which are the work of malicious
, ignorant, and suspicious persons, explains the reason why no mention of
 the discovery was made to contemporary archaeologists, and the pleasure
 of re-discovering the secret of the Acilii Glabriones was reserved for
 us.

 These words long since gave rise to a conjecture that Pomponia Graecina

 I shall have the occasion to refer to many Christian relatives of the emperors

 Eusebius, in speaking of these Flavians, and particularly of Domitilla

 He evidently means Bruttius Praesens, the illustrious friend of Pliny the
 younger, and the grandfather of Crispina, the empress of Commodus.
 If, therefore, the history of Domitilla's martyrdom was written by the
 grandfather of Bruttia Crispina, the empress, it seems probable that the
 two families were united not only by the close proximity of their villas

First of all, the Roman emperors gave plenty of liberty to the new religion
 from time to time; and some of them, moved by a sort of religious syncretism,
 even tried to ally it with the official worship of the empire, and to place

 The first attempt of the kind is attributed to Tiberius; he is alleged
 to have sent a message to the Senate requesting that Christ should be included
 among the gods, on the strength of the official report written by Pontius
 Pilatus of the passion and death of our Lord.
 Malala says that Nero made honest inquiries about the new religion, and
 that, at first, he showed himself rather favorable towards it; a fact not
 altogether improbable, if we take into consideration the circumstances

The wavering between public honors and Christian retirement is illustrated
 by some incidents in the life of Licentius, a disciple of S.
 Augustine.
 Licentius was the son of Romanianus, a friend and countryman of Augustine;
 and when the latter retired to the villa of Verecundus, after his conversion,
 in the year 386, Licentius, who had attended his lectures on eloquence
 at Milan, followed him to his retreat.
 He appears as one of the speakers in the academic disputes which took place
 in the villa.

 In 396, Licentius, who had followed his master to Africa, seduced by the
 hopes of a brilliant career, determined to settle in Rome.
 Augustine, deeply grieved at losing his beloved pupil, wrote to call him
 back, and entreated him to turn his face from the failing promises of the
 world.
 The appeal had no effect, and no more had the epistles, in prose and verse,
 addressed to him for the same purpose by Paulinus of Nola.
 Licentius, after finishing the course of philosophy, being scarcely a catechume
n, and a very unsteady one at that, entered a career for public honors.
 Paulinus of Nola describes him as aiming not only at a consulship, but
 also at a pagan pontificate, and reproaches and pities him for his behavior.
 After this, we lose sight of Licentius in history, but a discovery made
 at S.
 Lorenzo fuori le Mura in December, 1862, tells us the end of the tale.
 A marble sarcophagus was found, containing his body, and his epitaph.
 This shows that Licentius died in Rome in 406, after having reached the
 end of his desires, a place in the Senate; and that he died a Christian,
 and was buried near the tomb of S.
 Lorenzo.
 This sarcophagus, hardly noticed by visitors in spite of its great historical
 associations, is preserved in the vestibule of the Capitoline Museum.

As regards mixed marriages, a discovery made in 1877, near the Porta del

 century, containing these strange and enigmatic words:

 Here followed the specification of the penalties which the violator of
 the tomb would incur.
 It was thought at first that the phrase

\end_layout

\end_inset

 had been dictated by the father as a jocose hint of the religious inconsistency
 of the girl; but such an explanation can hardly be accepted.
 A passage of Tertullian in connection with mixed marriages leads us to
 the true understanding of the epitaph.
 In the second book Ad Uxorem, Tertullian describes the state of habitual
 apostasy to which Christian girls marrying gentiles willingly exposed or
 submitted themselves, especially when the husband was kept in ignorance
 of the religion of the bride.
 He mentions the risks they would incur of betraying their conscience by
 accompanying their husbands to state or civil ceremonies, thus sanctioning
 acts of idolatry by the mere fact of their presence.
 In the book De Corona, he concludes his argument with the words: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 lead us back to idolatry and superstition.

 The girl buried on the Via Flaminia, by the modern Porta del Popolo, must
 have been born of a Christian mother and a good-natured pagan father; still,
 it seems hardly consistent with the respect which the ancients had for
 tombs that he should be allowed to write such extraordinary words on that
 of his own daughter.

We must not believe, however, that gentiles and Christians lived always
 at swords' points.
 Italians in general, and Romans in particular, are noted for their great
 tolerance in matters of religion, which sometimes degenerates into apathy
 and indifference.
 Whether it be a sign of feebleness of character, or of common sense, the
 fact is, that religious feuds have never been allowed to prevail among
 us.
 In no part of the world have the Jews enjoyed more freedom and tolerance
 than in the Roman Ghetto.
 The same feelings prevailed in imperial Rome, except for occasional outbursts
 of passion, fomented by the official persecutors.

 This being the case, how can we account for the names of Paul and Peter,
 which, taken separately, give great probability, and taken together give
 almost absolute certainty, of having been adopted in remembrance of the
 two apostles? One circumstance may help us to explain the case: the preference
 shown for the name of Paul over that of Peter; the former was borne by
 both father and son, the latter appears only as a surname given to the
 son.
 This fact is not without importance, if we recollect that the two men who
 show such partiality for the name of Paul belong to the family of Anneus
 Seneca, the philosopher, whose friendship with the apostle has been made
 famous by a tradition dating at least from the beginning of the fourth
 century.
 The tradition rests on a foundation of truth.
 The apostle was tried and judged in Corinth by the proconsul Marcus Anneus
 Gallio, brother of Seneca; in Rome he was handed over to Afranius Burro,
 prefect of the praetorium, and an intimate friend of Seneca.
 We know, also, that the presence of the prisoner, and his wonderful eloquence
 in preaching the new faith, created a profound sensation among the members
 of the praetorium and of the imperial household.
 His case must have been inquired into by the philosopher himself, who happened
 to be 
\begin_inset ERT

 at the time.
 The modest tombstone, discovered by accident among the ruins of Ostia,
 gives us the evidence of the bond of sympathy and esteem established, in
 consequence of these events, between the Annei and the founders of the
 Church in Rome.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Its resemblance to the name of the Annei reminds me of another remarkable
 discovery connected with the same city, and with the same question.
 There lived at Ostia, towards the middle of the second century, a manufacturer
 of pottery and terracottas, named Annius Ser\SpecialChar \ldots{}
, whose lamps were exported
 to many provinces of the empire.
 These lamps are generally ornamented with the image of the Good Shepherd;
 but they show also types which are decidedly pagan, such as the labors
 of Hercules, Diana the huntress, etc.
 It has been surmised that Annius Ser\SpecialChar \ldots{}
 was converted to the gospel, and that
 the adoption of the symbolic figure of the Redeemer on his lamps was a
 result of his change of religion; but to explain the case it is not necessary
 to accept this theory.
 I believe he was a pagan, and that the lamps with the Good Shepherd were
 produced by him to order, and from a design supplied to him by a member
 of the local congregation.

 They are surely genuine and ancient.
 I examined them in company with Mommsen, Jordan, and de Rossi, and they
 attributed them to the beginning of the third century of our era.
 The best suggestion regarding their origin is that they belong to a person,
 probably Christian, who used the name Petrus as

 the second mentions the name of a little girl, Publia Aelia Proba, who

 making a show of their persuasion, and were buried among the gentiles.

Another stray Christian military tomb, erected by a captain of the sixth
 battalion, named Claudius Ingenuus, was found, in 1868, in the Vigna Grandi,
 near S.

 Here also we find the intention of avoiding an open profession of faith.
 A regular cemetery of Christian praetorians was found in the spring of
 the same year by Marchese Francesco Patrizi, in his villa adjoining the
 praetorian camp.
 It is neither large nor interesting, and it seems to prove that the gospel
 must have made but few proselytes in the imperial barracks.

We must not believe that the transformation of Rome from a pagan into a
 Christian city was a sudden and unexpected event, which took the world
 by surprise.
 It was the natural result of the work of three centuries, brought to maturity
 under Constantine by an inevitable reaction against the violence of Diocletian'
s rule.
 It was not a revolution or a conversion in the true sense of these words;
 it was the official recognition of a state of things which had long ceased
 to be a secret.
 The moral superiority of new doctrines over the old religions was so evident,
 so overpowering, that the result of the struggle had been a foregone conclusion
 since the age of the first apologists.
 The revolution was an exceedingly mild one, the transformation almost impercept
ible.
 No violence was resorted to, and the tolerance and mutual benevolence so
 characteristic of the Italian race was adopted as the fundamental policy
 of State and Church.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The transformation may be followed stage by stage in both its moral and
 material aspect.
 There is not a ruin of ancient Rome that does not bear evidence of the
 great change.
 Many institutions and customs still flourishing in our days are of classical
 origin, and were adopted, or tolerated, because they were not in opposition
 to Christian principles.
 Beginning with the material side of the question, the first monument to
 which I have to refer is the Arch of Constantine, raised in 315 at the
 foot of the Palatine, where the Via Triumphalis diverges from the Sacra
 Via.

 Cavedoni was the first to declare that the inscription had never been altered,

 name of the true God in the face of imperial Rome — belonged to the original
 text, sanctioned by the Senate.
 The controversy was settled in 1863, when Napoleon III.
 obtained from the Pope the permission to make a plaster cast of the arch.
 With the help of the scaffolding, the scholars of the time examined the
 inscription, the shape of each letter, the holes of the bolts by which
 the gilt-bronze letters were fastened, the joints of the marble blocks,
 the color and quality of the marble, and decided unanimously that the inscripti

The arch was raised in 315.
 Was Constantine openly professing his faith at that time? Opinions are
 divided.
 Some think he must have waited until the defeat of Licinius in 323; others
 suggest the year 311 as a more probable date of his profession.
 The supporters of the first theory quote in its favor the fact that pagan
 symbols and images of gods appear on coins struck by Constantine and his
 sons; but this fact is easily explained, when we consider that the coinage
 of bronze was a privilege of the Senate, and that the Senate was pagan
 by a large majority.
 Many of Constantine's constitutions and official letters speak in favor
 of an early declaration of faith.

Such being the state of affairs when the triumphal arch was erected, nothing

 the relations then existing between the first Christian emperor and the
 old pagan Senate.

Many facts related by contemporary documents prove that change of religion
 was, at the beginning, a personal affair with the emperor, and not a question
 of state; the emperor was a Christian, but the old rules of the empire
 were not interfered with.
 In dealing with his pagan subjects Constantine showed so much tact and
 impartiality as to cast doubts upon the sincerity of his conversion.
 He has been accused of having accepted from the people of Hispellum (Spello,
 in Umbria), the honor of a temple, and from the inhabitants of Roman Africa
 that of a priesthood for the worship of his own family (

 The subject is so comprehensive, and in a certain sense so well known,
 that I must satisfy myself by mentioning only a few particulars connected
 with recent discoveries.
 First, as to symbolic images allowed in churches and cemeteries.
 Of Orpheus playing on the lyre, while watching his flock, as a substitute
 for the Good Shepherd, there have been found in the catacombs four paintings,
 two reliefs on sarcophagi, one engraving on a gem.
 Here is the latest representation discovered, from the Catacombs of Priscilla

 Montfaucon describes the tomb of the poet Sannazzaro in the church of the

 In the eighteenth century the ecclesiastical authorities tried to give

In the next chapter I shall speak of ancient temples as museums of statuary,
 galleries of pictures, and cabinets of precious objects.
 I need not describe the acceptance and development of this tradition by
 the Church.
 To it we are indebted for the inexhaustible wealth in works of art of every
 kind, of which Italy is so proud.
 But in the period which elapsed between the fall of the empire and the
 foundation of the Cosmati school, the Christians were compelled, by the
 want of contemporary productions, to borrow works of art and decorative
 fragments from temples, palaces, and tombs.
 The gallery of the Candelabra, in the Vatican museum, has been formed mostly
 of specimens formerly set up in churches.
 The accompanying cut represents the candelabrum still existing in the church
 of SS.
 Nereo ed Achilleo, one of the most exquisite and delicate works of the
 kind.
 The Biga, or two-horse chariot, in the Vatican, was used for centuries
 as an episcopal throne in the choir of S.
 Mark's.
 In the church of the Aracoeli there was an altar dedicated to Isis by some
 one who had returned safely from a perilous journey.
 This bore the conventional emblem of two footprints, which were believed
 by the Christians to be the footprints of the angel seen by Gregory the
 Great on the summit of Hadrian's tomb.

 The faithful, raising their eyes towards the tribune, could see the figures
 of Christ and his apostles in mosaic; turning to the side walls, they could
 see Nero, Galba, and six other Roman emperors, Diana hunting the stag,
 Hylas stolen by the nymphs, Cybele on the chariot drawn by lions, a lion
 attacking a centaur, the chariot of Apollo, figures performing mysterious
 Egyptian rites, and other such profanities, represented in opus sectile
 marmoreum, a sort of Florentine mosaic.
 This unique set of intarsios was destroyed in the sixteenth century by
 the French Antonian monks for a reason worth relating.
 They believed that the glutinous substance by which the layer of marble
 or mother-of-pearl was kept fast was an excellent remedy against the ague;
 hence every time one of them was attacked by a fever, a portion of those
 marvellous works was sacrificed.
 Fever must have raged quite fiercely among the French monks, because when
 this wanton practice was stopped, only four pictures were left.
 Two are now preserved in the church of S.

 Quattro Fontane, on the landing of the stairs.

 murmuring prayers in memory of the passion of the Lord.

The most curious and interesting is perhaps the column of Henry IV.
 of France, which was erected under Clement VIII.
 in front of S.
 Antonio all'Esquilino, and which the modern generation has concealed in
 a recess on the east side of S.
 Maria Maggiore.
 It is in the form of a culverin — a long slender cannon of the period —
 standing upright.
 From the muzzle rises a marble cross supporting the figure of Christ on
 one side, and that of the Virgin on the other.
 It was erected by Charles d'Anisson, prior of the French Antonians, to
 commemorate the absolution given by Clement VIII.
 to Henry IV.
 of France and Navarre, on September 17 of the year 1595.
 The monument has a remarkable history.
 Although apparently erected by private enterprise, the kings of France
 regarded it as an insult of the Curia, an official boast of their submission
 to the Pope; and they lost no opportunity of showing their dissatisfaction
 in consequence.
 Louis XIV.
 found an occasion for revenge.
 The gendarmes who had escorted his ambassador, the duc de Crequi, to Rome,
 had a street brawl with the Pope's Corsican body-guards; and although it
 was doubtful which side was to blame, Louis obliged Pope Alexander VII.
 to raise a pyramid on the spot where the affray had taken place, with the
 following humiliating inscription:
\end_layout

In denunciation of the murderous attack committed by the Corsican soldiers

 declares their nation deprived forever of the privilege of serving under

 This monument was erected May 21, 1664, according to the agreement made
 at Pisa.

The revenge could not have been more complete; so bitter was it that Alexander

 drew a violent protest, to be read and published only after his death.
 His successor, Clement IX., a favorite with Louis XIV., obtained leave that
 the pyramid should be demolished, which was done in June, 1668, with the
 consent of the French ambassador, the duc de Chaulmes.
 Whether by stipulation or by the good will of the Pope, the inscription

Many drinking-cups used on these occasions have been found in Rome, in my

 They are generally works of the fourth century of our era, cut in glass
 by unskillful hands, and they show the portrait-heads of SS.
 Peter and Paul, in preference to other subjects of the kind.
 This fact is due not only to the special veneration which the Romans professed
 for the founders of their church, but also to the habit of celebrating
 their anniversary, June 29, with public or domestic

 They may be divided into three classes: In the first, and by far the most
 important, a plentiful supply of breadstuffs was kept at the expense of
 the state, to meet emergencies of scarcity or famine, and the wants of
 a population one third of which was fed gratuitously by the sovereign.
 The second was intended especially for the storage of paper (
