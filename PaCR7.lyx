 In this respect there was no distinction between Christians, pagans, and
 Jews; all enjoyed the same privileges, and were subject to the same rules.
 It is not easy to decide whether this condition of things was an advantage
 to the faithful.
 It was certainly advantageous to the Church that her cemeteries should
 be considered sacred by the law, and that the State itself should enforce
 and guarantee the observance of the rules (

 Roman epitaphs constantly refer to this authority of the pontiffs, and
 one of them, discovered by Ficoroni in July, 1730, near the Porta Metronia,
 contains the correspondence exchanged the subject between the two parties.
 The petitioner, Arrius Alphius, a favorite freedman of the mother of Antoninus
 Pius, writes to the high priests:

The greatest difficulty with which the Christians had to deal was the obligation
 to perform expiatory sacrifices in given circumstances; as, for instance,
 when a corpse was removed from one place to another, or when a coffin,
 damaged by any accidental cause, such as lightning, inundation, fire, earthquak
e, or violence, had to be opened and the bones exposed to view.
 But these were exceptional cases; and there is no doubt that the magistrates
 of Rome were naturally lenient and forbearing in religious matters, except
 in time of persecution.
 The partiality shown by early Christians for underground cemeteries is
 due to two causes: the influence which Eastern customs and the example
 of the burial of Christ must necessarily have exercised on them, and the
 security and freedom which they enjoyed in the darkness and solitude of
 their crypts.
 Catacombs, however,

 of their existence.
 Cities and villages built on alluvial or marshy soil, or on hills of limestone
 or lava, were obliged to resort to open-air cemeteries.
 In Rome itself these were not uncommon.
 Certainly there was no reason why Christians should object to the authority
 of the pontiffs in hygienic and civic matters.
 This authority was so deeply rooted and respected, that the emperor Constans
 (346--350), although a stanch Christian and anxious to abolish idolatry,
 left the pontiffs full jurisdiction over Christian and pagan cemeteries,
 by a constitution issued in 349.

From apostolic times to the persecution of Domitian, the faithful were buried,
 separately or collectively, in private tombs which did not have the character
 of a Church institution.
 These early tombs, whether above or below ground, display a sense of perfect
 security, and an absence of all fear or solicitude.
 This feeling arose from two facts: the small extent of the cemeteries,
 which secured to them the rights of private property, and the protection
 and freedom which the Jewish colony in Rome enjoyed from time immemorial.
 The Romans of the first century, populace as well as government officials,
 made no distinction between the proselytes of the Old Testament and those
 of the New.

The persecution which took place under Claudius was really the first connected
 with the preaching of the gospel.
 According to Suetonius (Claud.
 25) the Jews themselves were the cause of it, having suddenly become uneasy,
 troublesome, and offensive,

\end_inset

, that is to say, on account of Christ's doctrine, which was beginning to
 be preached in their synagogues.
 The expression used by Suetonius shows how very little was known at the
 time about the new religion.
 Although Christ's name was not unknown to him, he speaks of this outbreak
 under Claudius as having been stirred up personally by a certain Chrestus,
 as though he were a living member of the Jewish colony.
 At that early stage the converts to the gospel were identified by the Romans
 with the Jews, not by mistake or error of judgment, but because they were
 legally and actually Jews, 
\begin_inset Marginal

or rather one Jewish sect which was carrying on a dogmatic war against the
 others, on a point which had no interest whatever in the eyes of the Romans,
 — that is, the advent of the Messiah.
 This statement is corroborated by many passages in the Acts, such as xviii.15;
 xxiii.29; xxv.9; xxvi.28, 32; xxviii.31.
 Claudius Lysias writes to the governor of Judaea that Paul was accused
 by his fellow-citizens, not of crimes deserving punishment, but on some
 controversial point concerning their law.
 In Rome itself the apostle could preach the gospel with freedom, even when
 in custody, or under police supervision.

 And as it was lawful for a Roman citizen to embrace the Jewish persuasion,
 and give up the religion of his fathers, he was equally free to embrace
 the Evangelic faith, which was considered by the pagans a Jewish sect,
 not a new belief.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The pagans despised them both, and mixed themselves up with their affairs
 only from a fiscal point of view, because the Jews were subject to a tax
 of two drachms per head, and the treasury officials were obliged to keep
 themselves acquainted with the statistics of the colony.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This state of things did not last very long, it being of vital importance
 for the Jews to separate their cause from that of the new-comers.
 The responsibility for the persecutions which took place in the first century
 must be attributed to them, not to the Romans, whose tolerance in religious
 matters had become almost a state rule.
 The first attempt, made under Claudius, was not a success: it ended, in
 fact, with the banishment from the capital of every Jew, no matter whether
 he believed in the Old or the New Testament.

come back to their Transtiberine haunts the Jews set to work again, exciting
 the feelings of the populace, and denouncing the Christians as conspiring
 against the State and the gods, under the protection of the law which guarantee
d to the Jews the free exercise of their religion.
 The populace, impressed by the conquests made by the gospel among all classes
 of citizens, was only too ready to believe the calumny.
 The Church, repudiated by her mother the Synagogue, could no longer share
 the privileges of the Jewish community.
 As for the State, it became a necessity either to recognize Christianity
 as a new legal religion, or to proscribe and condemn it.
 The great fire, which destroyed half of Rome under Nero, and which was
 purposely attributed to the Christians, brought the situation to a crisis.
 The first persecution began.
 Had the magistrate who conducted the inquiry been able to prove the indictment
 of arson, perhaps the storm would have been short, and confined to Rome;
 but as the Christians could easily exculpate themselves, the trial was
 changed from a criminal into a politico-religious one.
 The Christians were convicted not so much of arson (

); a formula which includes anarchism, atheism, and high treason.
 This monstrous accusation once admitted, the persecution could not be limited
 to Rome; it necessarily became general, and more violent in one place or
 another, according to the impulse of the magistrate who investigated this
 entirely unprecedented case.

\begin_layout Standard
Was the hope of a legal existence lost forever to the Church? After Nero's
 death, and the condemnation of his acts and memory, the Christians enjoyed

 These measures were abolished shortly after by Nerva, who sanctioned the
 rule that in future no one should be brought to justice under the plea
 of impiety or Judaism.
 The answer given by Trajan to Pliny the younger, when governor of Bithynia,

 These words contain the solemn recognition of the illegality of Christian
 worship; they make persecution a rule of state.
 The faithful were doomed to have no respite for the next two centuries,
 except what they could obtain at intervals from the personal kindness and
 tolerance of emperors and magistrates.
 Those of the Jewish religion continued to enjoy protection and privileges,
 but Christianity was either persecuted or tolerated, as it happened; so
 that, even under emperors who abhorred severity and bloodshed, the faithful
 were at the mercy of the first vagrant who chanced to accuse them of impiety.

 The historian Eusebius, an eye-witness, says that when the persecutors

 They put out the right eyes of the confessors, cut the tendon of their

From the time of the apostles to the first persecution of Domitian, Christian
 tombs, whether above or below ground, were built with perfect impunity
 and in defiance of public opinion.
 We have been accustomed to consider the catacombs of Rome as crypts plunged
 in total darkness, and penetrating the bowels of the earth at unfathomable
 depths.
 This is, in a certain measure, the case with those catacombs, or sections
 of catacombs, which were excavated in times of persecution; but not with
 those belonging to the first century.
 The cemetery of these members of Domitian's family who had embraced the
 gospel — such as Flavius Clemens, Flavia Domitilla, Plautilla, Petronilla,
 and others — reveals a bold example of publicity.

The entrance to the crypt, discovered in 1714 and again in 1865, near the
 farmhouse of Tor Marancia, at the first milestone of the Via Ardeatina,
 is hewn out of a perpendicular cliff, which is conspicuous from the high
 road (the modern Via delle Sette Chiese).
 The crypt is approached through a vestibule, which was richly decorated
 with terra-cotta carvings, and, on the frieze, a monumental inscription
 enclosed by an elaborate frame.
 No pagan mausolea of the Via Appia or the Via Latina show a greater sense
 of security or are placed more conspicuously than this early Christian
 tomb.
 The frescoes on the ceiling of the vestibule, representing biblical scenes,
 such as Daniel in the lions' den, the history of Jonah, etc., were exposed
 to daylight, and through the

 No precaution was taken to conceal these symbolic scenes from profane or

 In this very catacomb, a few steps from the vestibule, an inscription has
 been found, in which a Marcus Aurelius Restitutus declares that he has

, no matter what the creed of the deceased had been, a vague sense of anxiety
 was felt by the Church, lest even these last refuges should be violated
 by the mob and its leaders.
 Hence the extraordinary development which underground cemeteries underwent
 towards the end of the first and the beginning of the second century.
 These catacombs were considered by the law to be the property of the citizen
 who owned the ground above, and who either excavated them at his own cost,
 or gave the privilege of doing so to the Church.
 This is the reason why the names of our oldest suburban cemeteries are
 derived, not from the illustrious saints buried in them, but from the owner
 of the property under which the catacomb was first excavated.
 Balbina, Callixtus, Domitilla were never laid to rest in the catacombs
 which bear their names.
 Praetextatus, Apronianus, the Jordans, Novella, Pontianus, and Maximus,
 after whom other cemeteries are named, are all totally unknown persons.
 When these cemeteries became places of worship and pilgrimage, after the
 Peace of Constantine, the old names which had sheltered them from the violence
 of persecutors were abandoned, and replaced by those of local martyrs.
 Thus the catacomb of Domitilla became that of Nereus and Achilleus; that
 of Balbina was named for S.
 Mark; that of Callixtus for SS.
 Sixtus and Caecilia; and that of Maximus for S.
 Felicitas.

One characteristic of Christian epigraphy shows what a comparatively safe
 place the catacombs were.

 graves, take the form of an

The safety of the catacombs was not due to the fact that their existence
 was known only to the proselytes of Christ.
 The magistrates possessed a thorough knowledge of their location, number,
 and extent; and we have evidence of raids and descents by the police on
 extraordinary occasions, as, for instance, during the persecutions of Valerian
 and Diocletian.
 The ordinary entrances to the catacombs, which were known to the police,
 were sometimes walled up or otherwise concealed, and new secret outlets
 opened through abandoned pozzolana quarries (

 page 3: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Of Christian inscriptions in Rome, during the first six centuries, de Rossi
 has studied more than fifteen thousand, the immense majority of which were
 taken from the catacombs; and he tells us there is still an average yearly
 addition of about five hundred, derived from the same source.
 This number, vast as it is, is but a poor remnant of what once existed.
 From the collections made in the eighth and ninth centuries it appears
 that there were once at least one hundred and seventy ancient Christian
 inscriptions in Rome, which had an historical or monumental character;
 written generally in metre, and to be seen at that time in the places which
 they were intended to illustrate.
 Of these only twenty-six remain, either whole or in parts.
 In the Roman topographies of the seventh century, one hundred and forty
 sepulchres of famous martyrs and confessors are enumerated; we have recovered
 only twenty inscribed memorials, to assist us in the identification of
 these.
 Only nine epitaphs have come to light belonging to the bishops of Rome
 during the same six centuries; and yet, during that period, there were
 certainly buried in the suburbs of the city upwards of sixty.
 Thus, whatever facts we take as the basis of our calculation, it would
 seem that scarcely a seventh part of the original wealth of the Roman church
 in memorials of this kind has survived the wreck of ages; and de Rossi
 gives it as his conviction that there were once

 It is difficult to explain why the Goths, confessed and even bigoted Christians
 (Arians) as they were, and full of respect for the basilicas of S.
 Peter and S.
 Paul, as Procopius declares, should have ransacked the catacombs, violated
 the tombs of martyrs, and broken their historical inscriptions.
 Perhaps it was because none of the barbarians could read Latin or Greek
 epitaphs, and make the distinction between pagan and Christian cemeteries;
 or perhaps they were moved by the desire of finding hidden treasures, or
 securing relics of saints.
 Whatever may have been the reason of their behavior, we must remember that
 two encampments, at least, of the Goths were just over catacombs and around
 their entrances; one on the Via Salaria, over those of Thrason; the other
 on the Via Labicana, above those of Peter and Marcellinus.
 The barbarians could not resist the temptation of exploring those subterranean
 wonders; indeed they were obliged to do so by the most elementary rules
 of precaution in order to insure the safety of their entrenchments against

Nibby has attributed the origin of cemeteries within the walls to the invasion
 of Vitiges, burial within the city limits having been strictly forbidden
 by the laws of Rome.
 But the law seems to have been practically disregarded even before the
 Gothic wars.
 Christians were buried in the Praetorian camp, and in the gardens of Maecenas,
 during the reign of Theodoric (493--526).
 I have mentioned this particular because it marks another step towards
 the abandonment of suburban cemeteries.
 The country around Rome having become insecure and deserted, it was deemed
 necessary to place within the protection of the city walls the bodies of
 martyrs who had been buried at a great distance from the gates.
 The first translation took place in 648: the second in 682, when the bodies
 of Primus and Felicianus were

 The first half of the ninth century thus marks the final abandonment of
 the catacombs, and the cessation of divine worship in their historical
 crypts.
 In later times we find little or no mention of them in Church annals.
 When we read of Nicholas I.
 (858--867) and of Paschal II.
 (1099--1118) visiting the cemeteries, we must believe that their visits
 were to the basilicas erected over the catacombs, and to their special
 crypts, not to the catacombs themselves.
 In the chronicle of the monastery of S.
 Michael ad Mosam we read of a pilgrim of the eleventh century who obtained
 relics of saints 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

from the keeper of a certain cemetery, in which lamps are always burning.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 He refers to the basilica of S.
 Valentine and the small hypogaeum attached to it (discovered in 1887),
 not to catacombs in the true sense of the word.
 The very last account referring directly to them dates from the time of
 Pope Nicolas I.
 (858--867) who is said to have restored the crypt of Mark on the Via Ardeatina,
 and of Felix, Abdon, and Sennen on the Via Portuensis.
 At this time also the visits of pilgrims, to whose itineraries, or guidebooks,
 we are indebted for some such knowledge of the topography of suburban cemeterie
s, come to an end.
 The best itineraries are those of Einsiedeln, Salzburg, Wurzburg, and William
 of Malmesbury; and the list of the oils from the lamps burning before the
 tombs of martyrs, which were collected by John, abbot of Monza, at the
 request of queen Theodolinda.
 The pilgrims left many records of their visits scratched on the walls of
 the sanctuaries; and to these

 It seems that the network of galleries, crossing one another at various

 the number of loculi with which the sides of the galleries were honeycombed,
 affected the imagination of visitors even more than the pictures, the sarcophag
i, and the epitaphs.
 The subjects of the frescoes were so varied as to contain almost the whole
 cycle of early Christian symbolism.
 There were the Good Shepherd and the Praying Soul, Noah and the

 These pious memorials of the primitive church led the learned visitors
 to investigate their meaning and value, as well as the history and name
 of those mysterious labyrinths.
 The origin of Christian archaeology, therefore, really dates from May 1,
 1578.
 Antonio Bosio, the Columbus of subterranean Rome, was but three years old
 at that time, but he seems to have developed his marvellous instinct on
 the strength of what he saw in the Vigna Sanchez in his boyhood.
 The crypts, however, had but a short life: the quarry-men damaged and robbed
 them to such an extent that, when Bosio began his career in 1593, every
 trace of them had disappeared.
 They have never been found since.
 We can only point out to the lover of these studies the site of the Vigna
 Sanchez.
 It is marked by a monumental gate, on the right side of the Via Salaria,
 crowned by the well-known coat-of‑arms of the della Rovere family, to whom
 the property was sold towards the end of the sixteenth century.
 The gate is a little more than a mile from the Porta Salaria.

From that time to the first quarter of the present century, we have to tell

 And who were responsible for this wholesale pillage? The very men — Aringhi,
 Boldetti, Marangoni, Bottari — who devoted their lives, energies and talents
 to the study of the catacombs, and to whom we are indebted for many standard
 works on Christian archaeology.
 Such was the spirit of the age.
 Whether an historical inscription came out of one

cemetery or another did not matter to them; the topographical importance
 of discoveries was not appreciated.
 Written or engraved memorials were sought, not for the sake of the history
 of the place to which they belonged, but to ornament houses, museums, villas,
 churches and monasteries.
 In 1863, de Rossi found a portion of the Cemetery of Callixtus, near the
 tombs of the Popes, in incredible confusion and disorder: loculi ransacked,
 their contents stolen, their inscriptions broken and scattered far and
 wide, and the bones themselves taken out of their graves.
 The perpetrators of the outrage had taken care to leave their names written
 in charcoal or with the smoke of tallow candles; they were men employed
 by Boldetti in his explorations of the catacombs, between 1713 and 1717.
 Some of the tombstones were removed by him to S.
 Maria in Trastevere, and inserted in the floor of the nave.
 Benedict XIV.
 took away the best, and placed them in the Vatican Library.
 They have now migrated again to the Museo Epigrafico of the Lateran Palace.
 Those left in the floor of S.
 Maria in Trastevere were removed to the vestibule of the church in 1865.

In 1714, some beautiful paintings of the first century were discovered in

 da Porto Maurizio, and G.

 de Rossi (the last two since canonized by the Church), and by hundreds

 ones either with a symbol, a word, or a date scratched in the fresh cement;
 or with some object of identification, such as glass cups, medallions,
 cameos, intaglios, objects cut in rock crystal, coral, etc.
 If the work of exploration has been carried on actively in the last three
 centuries, it is on account of the rich harvest which searching parties
 were sure to reap whenever they chanced to come across a catacomb or part

 Beatrix, who was anxiously watching the banks of the river for the recovery

 She buried them in a small Christian cemetery which a certain Generosa

 Beatrix, left alone in the world, found shelter in the house of one of
 the Lucinas; but the persecutors, to whom her pious action had evidently
 been reported, discovered her retreat, and killed her by suffocation, seven

 of the Dea Dia.
 The chapel lasted until the pontificate of Leo II., when it became evident

 for many miles around, and directly in the path of pirates and invaders

The Villa Amaranthiana, from which the modern name of Torre Marancia is
 derived, belonged to two ladies, one of imperial descent, Flavia Domitilla,
 a relative of Domitian and Titus, the other of patrician birth, Munatia
 Procula, the daughter of Marcus.
 Domitilla's name appears twice in documents attesting her ownership of
 the ground; the first is the grant of a sepulchral area, measuring

These concessions refer to burial-plots above ground, on the Via Ardeatina.
 Much more important was the permission given by Domitilla for the excavation
 of a catacomb in the service of the Church, which had just been established
 in Rome by the apostles.
 The catacomb consisted originally of two sections; one for the use of those
 members of the imperial Flavian family who had been converted to the gospel,
 and one for common use.
 I have already given a brief account of the first (see p.

Under the pavement of the nave, aisles, and presbytery, are numberless graves,
 some of which belong to the original catacombs, before they were cut and
 disarranged by the building of the basilica; others are built in accordance
 with the architectural lines of the basilica itself.
 A grave belonging to the first series, that is, to a gallery of the catacombs
 which had been blocked by the foundations of the left aisle, bears the
 date of the year 390; while a sarcophagus placed at the foot of the altar
 is dated Monday, May 12, 395.
 It is evident, therefore, that the basilica was built between 390 and 395,
 during the pontificate of Siricius.

No memorial of Petronilla, the third saint for whom the building was named,

 In November, 1875, a cubiculum was found at the back of the apse, connected

), in the sarcophagus below the picture.
 There is no doubt that Petronilla was buried in close proximity to this
 cubiculum.
 The story of her relationship to S.
 Peter has no foundation whatever; it rests on an etymological mistake,
 by which the name Petronilla is treated as a diminutive of Petrus, as is
 Plautilla of Plautius or Plautia, and Domitilla of Domitius or Domitia.
 Petrus is not a Latin name; it came into use with the spreading of the
 gospel, and only in rare and exceptional cases.
 The young martyr was named after a member of the same Flavian family to
 which this cemetery belonged, Titus Flavius Petron, an uncle of Vespasian.
 Her kinship with the apostle must consequently be taken in a spiritual
 sense.

Towards the end of 1881 another remarkable discovery took place in these

 It looks more like the room of a Pompeian house than a Christian crypt.

 friezes, and enclosing pastoral landscapes, might be compared to the frescoes

 and one feels inclined to kneel before the tomb of the dear friend of the
 apostle.
 However, when discoveries of this kind happen, it is wise to proceed with
 caution, and examine every detail from a sceptical point of view.
 Doubtless the cubiculum of Ampliatus was made and painted in the first
 century of our era.
 The type of the letters engraved above the tomb is peculiar to painted
 or written inscriptions of the beginning of the second century.
 It is possible, therefore, that the name was at first painted on the white
 plaster, and engraved on marble many years after the deposition of Ampliatus.
 As regards Ampliatus himself, it is true that according to Greek tradition
 he died when Bishop of Moesia,

 The exploration of underground Rome must be greeted with pleasure, not
 only by the pious believers in Christ and his martyrs, but also by agnostic
 students of classical history.
 A tombstone, which on one side is inscribed with the records of the victories
 gained by the imperial legions, on the other with the simple and humble
 name of a Christian who has given his life for his faith, is a monument
 worthy the consideration of all thoughtful men.
 Christian archaeology has an intimate and indissoluble connection with
 classical studies, and there is no discovery referring to the first century
 of Christianity which does not throw new and often unexpected light on
 general history, art, and science.
 Those made at Torre Marancia in 1875 illustrate the history of Rome and
 the Campagna, after the fall of the emperor.
 In the niche where the episcopal chair was placed, -- behind the high altar,

 priest, dressed in a casula, in the

 This sketch reminds us of Gregory the Great, when in this very cemetery
 of Nereus and Achilleus, in this very apse, he read one of his homilies
 from this episcopal chair, deploring to the panic-stricken congregation
 the state of the city, the queen of the world, desolated by famine, by
 pestilence, and by the Lombards, who at that very moment were burning and
 plundering the villas and farms of the surrounding Campagna.

 Whether performing one of the miracles which prove his divinity, or teaching
 the new doctrine to the disciples, the type never varies.
 It is evident that the Christian painters or sculptors of the first three
 centuries, in drawing or modelling the head of Jesus, had no intention
 of making a likeness, but only a conventional type, noble and classic,
 and suggestive of the eternal youth of the Word.
 A new tendency appears in Christian art towards the middle of the fourth
 century, the attempt to reproduce the genuine portrait of Christ, or what
 was regarded as such by the Orientals.
 The change was a consequence of the peace and freedom given to the Church,
 and of the cessation of that overbearing contempt in which the Gentiles
 had held 
\begin_inset Marginal

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_inset

a religion which they believed to be that of the vile followers of a crucified
 Jew.
 It had been considered prudent, at the outset, to present the Redeemer
 to the neophytes, who were not yet entirely free from pagan ideas, in a
 type which was familiar and pleasing to the Roman eye, rather than with
 the characteristics of a despised race.
 The triumph of the Church made these precautions unnecessary, and then
 arose the desire of exhibiting a truer portraiture of Christ.
 The first addition to the conventional type was that of the beard, and
 probably of the hair parted in the middle.

 Ancient writers have left but little information about the personal appearance
 of the Savior; and the vagueness of their accounts proves the absence of
 a type which was universally recognized as authentic.
 Many documents concerning this subject must be rejected as forgeries of
 a later age.
 Such is the pretended letter of Lentulus, governor of Judaea, to the Senate,

 in the Vatican, as fanciful as the old youthful type of the Good Shepherd?
 There can be no doubt that in some provinces of the East, like Palestine,
 Syria, and Phoenicia, the oral traditions about the personal appearance
 of the Saviour were kept for many generations.
 It is also probable that the tradition was confirmed by some work of art,
 like the celebrated group of Paneas (Bâniâs).
 With regard to this, Eusebius says that the woman with the issue of blood,
 grateful to the Saviour for her cure (Mark v., 25-‑34), caused a statue,
 representing Him in the act of performing the miracle, to be set up in
 front of her house; that it still existed when he wrote, and was held in
 great veneration throughout Palestine and the whole East.
 Sozomenos adds that Julian the Apostate substituted his own statue for
 it, but that the imperial image was struck by lightning.
 This excited the wrath of the pagans to such an extent that they destroyed
 the group of Christ and the Woman, which Julian had caused to be removed.
 Cassiodorus, Rufinus, Kedrenos, and Malala, assert that the head was saved
 from destruction.
 It has been suggested that the group did not represent the woman at the
 feet of the Saviour, but a conquered province kneeling before the Roman
 emperor and addressing him as her Saviour (

).
 But this explanation seems more ingenious than probable, because it implies
 that Christians, Eusebius included, had mistaken the portrait of a Roman
 conqueror for that of 
\begin_inset Marginal

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\end_inset

Christ, which would have been so different in type, dress, and attitude.
 At all events, the belief that the group of Bâniâs was a genuine likeness
 was general in the fourth century.
 Eusebius contributed to make it known in the Western world; and to this
 diffusion we probably owe the second type of the Saviour's physiognomy,
 the bearded face, the large impressive eyes, the hair parted in the middle,
 and falling in locks on the shoulders.
