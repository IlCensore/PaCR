 seems to have been more common than cremation in prehistoric Rome; enclosure,
 certain families, to give material evidence of their ancient lineage, would
 never submit to cremation.
 Such were the Cornelii Scipiones, whose sarcophagi were discovered during
 the last century in the Vigna Sassi.
 Sulla is the first Cornelius whose body was burned; but this he ordered
 done to avoid retaliation, that is to say, for fear of its being treated
 as he had treated the corpse of Marius.
 Both systems are mentioned in the law of the twelve tables:

This theory is confirmed by the discoveries in the prehistoric cemeteries
 of the Viminal and Esquiline hills, which contain coffins as well as cineraria,
 or ash-urns.
 The discoveries have been published only in a fragmentary way, so that
 we cannot yet follow their development stage by stage, and determine at
 what periods and within what limits the influence of more civilized neighbors
 was felt by the primitive dwellers upon the Seven Hills.
 One thing is certain; the race that first colonized the Campagna was buried
 in trunks of trees, hollowed inside and cut to measure, as is the custom
 among some Indian tribes of the present day.
 In March, 1889, the engineers who were attending to the drainage of the
 Lago di Castiglione — the ancient Regillus — discovered a trunk of quercus
 robur, sawn lengthways into two halves, with a human skeleton inside, and
 fragments of objects in amber and ivory lying in it.
 The coffin, roughly cut and shaped, was buried at a depth of fourteen feet,
\begin_inset Marginal
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
4.5m.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 in a trench a trifle longer and larger than itself, and the space between
 the coffin and the sides of the trench was filled with archaic pottery,
 of the type found in our own Roman necropolis of the Via dello Statuto.
 There were also specimens of imported pottery, and a bronze cup.
 The tomb and its contents are now exhibited in the Villa di Papa Giulio,
 outside the Porta del Popolo.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When Rome was founded, this semi-barbaric fashion of burial was by no means
 forgotten or abandoned by its inhabitants.
 We have not yet discovered coffins actually dug out of a tree, but we have
 found rude imitations of them in clay.
 These belong to the interval of time between the foundation of the city
 and the fortifications of Servius

\begin_layout Standard
Nearly every type of tomb known in Etruria, Magna Graecia, and the prehistoric
 Italic stations has a representative in the old cemeteries of the Viminal
 and the Esquiline.
 There are caves hewn out of the natural rock, with the entrance sealed
 by a block of the same material; in these are skeletons lying on the funeral
 beds on either side of the cave, or even on the floor between them, with
 the feet turned towards the door, and Italo-Greek pottery, together with
 objects in bronze, amber, and gold.
 There are also artificial caves, formed by horizontal courses of stones
 which project one beyond another, from both sides, till they meet at the
 top.
 Then there are bodies protected by a circle of uncut stones; others lying
 at the bottom of wells, and finally regular sarcophagi in the shape of
 square huts, and cineraria like those described on page 29 of my

Comparing these data we reach the conclusion that inhumation was abandoned,
 with a few exceptions, towards the end of the fifth century of Rome, to
 be resumed only towards the middle of the second century after Christ,
 under the influence of Eastern doctrines and customs.
 For the student of Roman archaeology these facts have not merely a speculative
 interest; a knowledge of them is necessary for the chronological classification
 of the material found in cemeteries and represented so abundantly in public
 and private collections.

, as they would more properly be called, owes its origin to the same cause.
 Columbaria are a specialty of Rome and the Campagna, and are found nowhere
 else, not even in the colonies or settlements originating directly from
 the city.
 They begin to appear some twenty years before Christ, under the rule of
 Augustus and the premiership of Maecenas.
 Inasmuch as the Campus Esquilinus, which, up to their time, had been used
 for the burial of artisans, laborers, servants, slaves, and freedmen, was
 suppressed in consequence of the sanitary reforms described by Horace,

 Tombstones often mention transactions of this kind, and state the cost
 of purchase for one or more loculi, or for the whole tomb.

There were three kinds of columbaria: first, those built by one man or one
 family either for their own private use, or for their servants and freedmen;
 second, those built by one or more individuals for speculation, in which
 any one could secure a place by purchase; third, those built by a company
 for the personal use of shareholders and contributors.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As a good specimen of the columbaria of the second kind we can cite one
 built on the Via Latina, by a company

of thirty-six shareholders.
 It was discovered in 1599, not far from the gate, and its records were
 scattered all over the city.
 As a proof of the negligence with which excavations were conducted in former
 times, we may state that, the same place having been searched again in
 1854 by a man named Luigi Arduini, other inscriptions of great value were
 discovered, from which we learn how these burial companies were organized
 and operated.
 The first document, a marble inscription above the door of the crypt, states
 that in the year 6

 thirty-six citizens formed a company for the building of a columbarium,
 each subscribing for an equal number of shares, and that they selected
 two of the shareholders to act as administrators.
 Their names are Marcus Aemilius, and Marcus Fabius Felix, and their official
 title is,

.
 They collected the contributions, bought the land, built the columbarium,
 approved and paid the contractors' bills, and having thus fulfilled their
 duty convened a general meeting for September 30.
 Their report was approved, and a deed was drawn up and duly signed by all
 present, declaring that the administrators had discharged their duty according
 to the statue.
 They then proceeded to the distribution of the loculi in equal lots, the
 loculi representing, as it were, the dividend of the company.
 The tomb contained one hundred and eighty loculi for cinerary urns, and
 each of the shareholders was consequently entitled to five.
 The distribution, however, was not so easy a matter as the number would
 make it appear.
 We know that it was made by drawing lots,

, and we know also that in some cases the shareholders, as a remuneration
 to their chairmen, administrators, and auditors of accounts, voted them
 exemption from the rule, by giving them the right of selecting their loculi
 without drawing (

).
 Evidently some places 
\begin_inset Marginal

were more desirable than others, and if we remember how columbaria are built,
 it is not difficult to see which loculi must have been most in demand.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The pious devotion of the Romans towards the dead caused them to pay frequent
 visits to their tombs, especially on anniversaries, when the urns were
 decorated with flowers, libations were offered, and other ceremonies performed.

, or rites, could be celebrated easily if the loculus and the cinerary urn
 were near the ground, while ladders were required to reach the upper tiers.
 The same difficulty was experienced when cinerary urns had to be placed
 in their niches; and the funeral tablets and memorials containing the name,
 age, condition, etc., of the deceased, which were either written in ink
 or charcoal, or else engraved on marble, could not be read if too high
 above the pavement.
 For these reasons, and to avoid any suspicion of partiality in the distribution
 of lots, the shareholders trusted to chance.
 The crypt discovered in the Via Latina contained five rows of niches of
 thirty-six each.
 The rows were called

The theory that Roman tombs were built along the high roads in two or three
 rows only, so that they could all be seen by those passing, has been shown
 by modern excavations to be unfounded.
 The space allotted for burial purposes was more extensive than that.
 Sometimes it extended over the whole stretch of land from one high-road
 to the next.
 Such is the case with the spaces between the Via Appia and the Via Latina,
 the Labicana and Praenestina, and the Salaria and Nomentana, each of which
 contains hundreds of acres densely packed with tombs.
 In the triangle formed by the Via Appia, the Via Latina, and walls of Aurelian,
 one thousand five hundred and fifty-nine tombs have been discovered in
 modern times, not including the family vault of the Scipios.

opposite end of the Farnesina Gardens, near the walls of Aurelian.
 A corner of this tomb had been exposed to view for a couple of years, nobody
 paying attention to it, because, as a rule, tombs within the walls, having
 been exposed for centuries to the thieving instincts of the populace in
 general, and of treasure-hunters in particular, are always found plundered
 and barren of contents.
 In this instance, however, it was our fortune to meet with a welcome exception
 to the rule.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From an inscription engraved on marble above the entrance door, we learn
 that the mausoleum was raised in memory of Caius Sulpicius Platorinus,
 a magistrate of the time of Augustus, and of his sister Sulpicia Platorina,
 the wife of Cornelius Priscus.
 The room contained nine niches, and each niche a cinerary urn, of which
 six were still untouched.
 These urns are of the most elaborate kind, carved in white marble, with
 festoons hanging from bulls' heads, and birds of various kinds eating fruit.
 Some of the urns are round, some square, the motive of the decoration being
 the same for all of them.
 The cover of the round ones is in the shape of a

The covers of these urns were fastened with molten lead.
 The unsealing of them was an event of great excitement; it was performed
 in the coffee-house of the Farnesina, in the presence of a large and distinguis
hed assembly.
 I remember the date, May 3, 1880.
 They were found to be half full of water from the last flood of the Tiber,
 with a layer of ashes and bones at the bottom.
 The contents were emptied on a sheet of white linen.
 Those of the first had no value; the second contained a gold ring without

stone, — which was found, however, in the third cinerarium; a most extraordinary
 circumstance.
 It can be explained by supposing that both bodies were cremated at the
 same time, and that their ashes were somehow mixed together.
 The stone, probably an onyx, was injured by the action of the fire, and
 its engraving nearly effaced.
 It seems to represent a lion in repose.
 Nothing was found in the fourth; the fifth furnished two heavy gold rings
 with cameos representing respectively a mask and a bear-hunt.
 The last urn, inscribed with the name of Minasia Polla, — a girl of about
 sixteen, as shown by the teeth and the size of some fragments of bone,
 — contained a plain hair-pin of brass.

Having thus finished with the cineraria and their contents, the exploration
 of the tomb itself was resumed.
 Inscriptions engraved on one of the parts of the frieze gave us a full
 list of the personages who had found their last resting-place within, besides
 the two Platorini, and the girl Minasia Polla, just mentioned.
 They are: Aulus Crispinus Caepio, who played an important part in court
 intrigues at the time of Tiberius; Antonia Furnilla; and her daughter,
 Marcia Furnilla, the second wife of Titus.

 the divorce is easily found, — she looks hopelessly disagreeable.

 It is a remarkable fact that in Rome not only men but animals should remain
 faithful to old habits and traditions.
 Some of my readers may have noticed how regularly every day, towards sunset,
 flights of crows are seen crossing the skies on their way to their night
 lodgings in the pine-trees of the Villa Borghese.
 They have two or three favorite halting-places, for instance the campanile
 of S.
 Andrea delle Fratte, the towers of the Trinità de' Monti, where they hold
 noisy meetings which last until the first stroke of the Ave-Maria.
 This sound is interpreted by them as a call to rest.
 Whether the area of the sacred crows described by Festus was planted with
 pines, and used as a rest at night, or simply as a halting-place, the fact

 of the Casino dei Quattro Venti (since added to the Villa Pamfili and transform

 found and destroyed for the sake of their building-materials.

 This wonderful racer, belonging to the squadron of the Greens, was named
 Volucris, the Flyer, and the emperor's admiration for his exploits was
 such that, after honoring him with statues of gilt-bronze in his lifetime,
 he raised a mausoleum to his memory in the Vatican grounds, after his career
 had been brought to a close.
 The selection of the site was not made at random, as we know that the Greens

 Here was found a piece of agate in the shape of a nut, so beautifully carved

 There was also a skeleton, the skull of which was found between the legs,
 and in its place there was a mask or plaster cast of the head, reproducing
 most vividly the features of the dead man.
 The cast is now preserved in the Pope's wardrobe.

A discovery of the same kind has come within my experience.
 In 1885, while excavating near the city walls, between the Porta S.
 Lorenzo and the Porta Maggiore, we found an amphora of great size, containing
 the corpse of a little child embedded in lime.
 He had probably died of a contagious disease.
 The corpse had been reduced to a handful of tiny bones; and the impression
 of them was so spoiled by dampness and age that it was found impossible

The scene is now changed, and not for the better.
 Still, if any one has no right to grumble, it is the archaeologist, because
 the building of these suburban quarters has placed more knowledge at his

 I quote only one instance.
 Famous in the annals of Roman excavations are those made between 1695 and
 1741 in the vineyard of the Naro family, between the Salaria and the Pinciana,
 back of the Casino di Villa Borghese.
 It took forty-six years to dig out the contents of that small property,
 which included twenty-six graves of praetorians and one hundred and forty-one
 of civilians.

In 1887, in cutting open the Corso d'Italia, which connects the Porta Pinciana
 with the Salaria, eight hundred and fifty-five tombs were discovered in
 nine months.
 The cemetery extends from the Villa Borghese to the praetorian camp, from
 the walls of Servius Tullius to the first milestone.
 The gardens of Sallust were surrounded by it on two sides; a striking contrast
 between the silent city of death on the one hand, and the merriest and
 noisiest meeting-place of the living on the other.

 Caligula, jealous of the high-sounding name, was the first to threaten
 his life; but spared it at the expense of the name.
 Claudius restored the title to him, as a wedding-present, on the day of
 his marriage with Antonia, daughter of the emperor himself by Aelia Paetina.
 His splendid career, his nobility and grace of manners, and his alliance
 with the imperial family, excited the hatred of Messalina, a foe far more

 Some are simply decorated with festoons, winged genii, scenic masks, or

The fate of the monument has been truly remarkable.
 I believe there is no other in the necropolis of the Via Salaria which
 has undergone so many changes in the course of centuries.
 The first took place in the reign of Trajan, when the monument was buried
 under a prodigious mass of earth, together with a large section of an adjoining
 cemetery.
 In fact, columbaria dating from the time of Hadrian have been found built
 against the beautiful inscription of Lucilia Polla; and the inscription
 itself was disfigured by a coating of red paint, to make it harmonize with
 the color of the three other walls of the crypt.
 The whole tract between the Salaria and the Pinciana was raised in the

 None but an emperor would have dared to bury a cemetery so important as
 that which I am now describing; and if we remember that it was the open
 space which was nearest of all to Trajan's excavations, easy of access,
 that the burying of a cemetery for a necessity of state could be justified
 by the proceedings of Maecenas and Augustus, described on page 67 of the
 same book, and that the change must have taken place at the beginning of
 the second century, as proved by these dates, and by the construction and
 type of tombs belonging respectively to the lower and upper strata, I think
 that my surmise may be accepted as an established fact.

Thus vanished the mausoleum of the Lucilii from the eyes and from the memory
 of the Romans of the second century.
 Towards the end of the fourth century the Christians, while tunnelling
 the ground near it, for one of their smaller catacombs, discovered the
 crypt by accident, and occupied it.
 The shape of this crypt may be compared to that of Hadrian's mausoleum;
 that is, it was a hall in the form of a Greek cross, in the centre of the
 circular structure, and was reached by means of a corridor.
 The Christians scattered the relics of the first occupants, knocked down
 their busts, built arcosolia in the three recesses of the Greek cross,
 and honeycombed with loculi the side walls of the corridor.
 The transformation was so complete that, when we first entered the corridor,
 in July, 1886, we thought we had found a wing of the catacombs of S.
 Saturninus.
 Some of the loculi were closed with tiles, others with pagan inscriptions
 which the

 Two loculi, excavated near the

 around their necks.
 They are most extraordinary objects in both material and variety of shape.
 The pendants are cut in bone, ivory, rock crystal, onyx, jasper, amethyst,
 amber, touch-stone, metal, glass, and enamel; and they represent elephants,
 bells, doves, pastoral flutes, hares, knives, rabbits, poniards, rats,
 Fortuna, jelly-fish, human arms, hammers, symbols of fecundity, helms,
 marbles, boar's tusks, loaves of bread, and so on.

The vicissitudes of the mausoleum did not end with this change of religion
 and ownership.
 Two or three centuries ago, when the fever of discovering and ransacking
 the catacombs of the Via Salaria was at its height, some one found his
 way to the crypt, and committed purely wanton destruction.
 The arcosolia were dismantled, and the loculi violated one by one.
 We found the bones of the Christians of the fourth century scattered over
 the floor, and, among them, the marble busts of Lucilius Paetus and Lucilia
 Polla, which the Christians of the fourth century had knocked from their
 pedestals.
 Such is the history of Rome.

 His father, Tiberius Claudius Atticus Herodes, lost his fortune by confiscation
 for reasons of state, and was therefore obliged, at the beginning of his
 career, to depend upon the fortune of his wife, Vibullia Alcia, for his
 support.
 Suddenly he became the richest man in Greece, and probably in the world.
 Many writers have given accounts of his extraordinary discovery of treasure,
 which was made in the foundations of a small house which he owned at the
 foot of the Akropolis, near the Dionysiac Theatre.
 He seems to have been more frightened than pleased at the amount found,
 knowing how complicated was the jurisprudence on this subject, and how
 greedy provincial magistrates were.
 He addressed himself in general terms to the emperor Nerva, asking what
 he should do with his discovery.
 The answer was that he could make use of it as he pleased.
 Even then he was not reassured, and wrote again to the emperor declaring
 that the 
\begin_inset Marginal

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_inset

fortune was far beyond his condition in life.
 Nerva's answer confirmed him emphatically in the full possession of his
 wealth.
 Herodes did much good with it, as a noble revenge for the persecutions
 which he had undergone in his younger days; and at his death his son inherited,
 with the fortune, his generous instincts and kindliness.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Curiosity leads us to inquire where this amount of gold and treasure came
 from, who it was that concealed it in the rock of the Akropolis, and when,
 and for what reason.
 Visconti's surmise that it was hidden there by a wealthy Roman, during
 the civic wars, and the proscriptions which followed them towards the end
 of the Republic, is obviously incorrect.
 No Roman general, magistrate, or merchant of republican times could have
 collected such a fortune in impoverished Greece.
 I have a more probable suggestion to make.
 When Xerxes engaged his fleet against the Greek allies in the straits of
 Salamis, he was so confident of gaining the day that he established himself
 comfortably on a lofty throne on the slope of Mount Aegaleos to witness
 the fight.
 And when he saw Fortune turn against his forces, and was obliged to retire
 in hot haste, trusting his own safety to flight, I suppose that the funds
 of war, which were kept by the treasurer of the army at headquarters, may
 have been buried in a cleft of the Akropolis, in the hope of a speedy and
 more successful return.
 The amount of money carried by Xerxes' treasury officials for purposes
 of war must have been enormous, when we consider that 2,641,000 men were
 counted at the review held in the plains of Doriskos.

 Still, the calumny remained in the mind of the public.
 To dispel it, and to regain his position in society, Herodes, although
 stricken with grief, made himself conspicuous almost to excess in honoring
 the memory of his departed wife.
 Her jewels were offered to Ceres and Proserpina; and the land which she
 had owned between the Via Appia and the valley of the Almo was covered
 with memorial buildings, and also consecrated to the gods.
 On the boundary line of the property, columns were raised bearing the inscripti

Higher up the valley, on a spur of the hill above the springs of Egeria,
 stands the Temple of Ceres and Faustina, now called S.
 Urbano alla Caffarella.
 It belongs to the Barberinis, who take good care of it, as well as of the
 sacred grove of ilexes which covers the slope to the south of the springs.
 The vestibule is supported by four marble pillars, but, the intercolumniations
 having been filled up by Urban VIII.
 in 1634, the picturesqueness of the effect is destroyed.
 Here Herodes dedicated to the memory of his wife a statue, minutely described

 Early Christians took possession of the temple and consecrated it to the

 restorations, these paintings form the most important contribution to the
 history of Italian art in the eleventh century.
 We have therefore under one roof, and within the four walls of this temple,
 the names of Ceres, Faustina, Herodes and Anna Regilla, coupled with those
 of S.
 Caecilia and S.
 Valerianus, of Paschal I., and Pope Barberini; decorations in stucco and
 brick of the time of Marcus Aurelius; paintings of the ninth and eleventh
 centuries; and all this variety of wealth intrusted to the care of a good

I need not remind the reader that the name of Egeria, given to the nymphaeum
 below the temple, is of Renaissance origin.
 The grotto in which, according to the legend, and to Juvenal's description,
 Numa held his secret meetings with the nymph Egeria, was situated within
 the line of the walls of Aurelian, and in the lower grounds of the Villa
 Fonseca, that is to say, at the foot of the Caelian Hill, near the Via
 della Ferratella.

To‑day, April 19, 1485, the news came into Rome, that a body buried a thousand
 years ago had been found in a farm of Santa Maria Nova, in the Campagna,
 near the Casale Rotondo\SpecialChar \ldots{}
 (f.
 49.) The Conservatori of Rome despatched a coffin to Santa Maria Nova elaboratel
y made, and a company of men for the transportation of the body into the
 city.
 The body has been placed for exhibition in the Conservatori palace, and
 large crown of citizens and noblemen have gone to see it.
 The body seems to be covered with a glutinous substance, a mixture of myrrh
 and other precious ointments, which attract swarms of bees.
 The said body is intact.
 The hair is long and thick; the eyelashes, eyes, nose, and ears are spotless,
 as well as the nails.
 It appears to be the body of a woman, of good size;

and her head is covered with a light cap of woven gold thread, very beautiful.
 The teeth are white and perfect; the flesh and the tongue retain their
 natural color; but if the glutinous substance is washed off, the flesh
 blackens in less than an hour.
 Much care has been taken in searching the tomb in which the corpse was
 found, in the hope of discovering the epitaph, with her name; it must be
 an illustrious one, because none but a noble and wealthy person could afford
 to be buried in such a costly sarcophagus thus filled with precious ointments.

 On the removal of this coating, which we believe to be composed of myrrh,
 frankincense, aloe, and other priceless drugs, a face appeared, so lovely,
 so pleasing, so attractive, that, although the girl had certainly been
 dead fifteen hundred years, she appeared to have been laid to rest that
 very day.
 The thick masses of hair, collected on the top of the head in the old style,
 seemed to have been combed then and there.
 The eyelids could be opened and shut; the ears and the nose were so well
 preserved that, after being bent to one side or the other, they instantly
 resumed their original shape.
 By pressing the flesh of cheeks the color would disappear as in a living
 body.
 The tongue could be seen through the pink lips; the articulation of the
 hands and feet still retained their elasticity.

 from the gate, at a place called Statuario (the same as S.
 Maria Nova).
 Some workmen engaged in searching for stones and marbles have discovered
 there a marble coffin of great beauty, with a female body in it, wearing
 a knot of hair on the back of her head, in the fashion now popular among
 the Hungarians.
 It was covered with a cap of woven gold, and tied with golden strings.
 Cap and strings were stolen at the moment of the discovery, together with
 a ring which she wore on the second finger of the left hand.
 The eyes were open, and the body preserved such elasticity that the flesh
 would yield to pressure, and retain its natural shape immediately.
 The form of the body was beautiful in the extreme; the appearance was that
 of a girl of twenty-five.
 Many identify her with Tulliola, daughter of Cicero, and I am ready to
 believe so, because I have seen, close by there, a tombstone with the name
 of Marcus Tullius; and because Cicero is known to have owned lands in the
 neighborhood.
 Never mind whose daughter she was; she was certainly noble and rich by
 birth.

 She lived twenty-six years and one month.
 She has committed no fault, except to die.' It seems that another name is
 engraved on the same coffin, that of a Claudius Hilarus, who died at forty-six.
 If we are to believe current rumors, the discoverers of the body have fled,

 The color of the flesh was absolutely lifelike.
 The eyes and mouth were partly open, and if one drew the tongue out slightly
 it would go back to its place of itself.
 During the first three days of the exhibition on the Capitol this wonderful
 relic showed no signs of decay; but after a time the action of the air
 began to tell upon it, and the face and hands turned black.
 The coffin seems to have been placed near the cistern of the Conservatori
 palace, so as to allow the crowd of visitors to move around and behold
 the wonder with more ease.
 Celio Rodigino says that the first symptoms of putrefaction were noticed
 on the third day; and he attributes the decay more to the removal of the
 coating of ointments than to the action of the air.
 Alexander ab Alexandro describes the ointment which filled the bottom of
 the coffin as having the appearance and scent of a fresh perfume.

 Either supposition is wrong.
 The first is invalidated by the fact that the body was of a young and tender
 girl, while Tulliola is known to have died in childbirth at the age of
 thirty-two.
 Moreover, there is no document to prove that Cicero had a family vault
 at the sixth milestone of the Appian Way.
 The tomb of Priscilla, wife of Abascantus, a favorite freedman of Domitian,
 is placed by Statius near the bridge of the Almo (Fiume Almone, Acquataccio)

 The only clew worth following is that given in Pehem's letter of April

How differently we treat these discoveries in our days! In the early morning
 of May 12, 1889, I was called to witness the opening of a marble coffin
 which had been discovered two days before, under the foundations of the
 new Halls of Justice, on the right bank of the Tiber, near Hadrian's Mausoleum.
 As a rule, the ceremony of cutting the brass clamps which fasten the lids
 of urns and sarcophagi is performed in one of our archaeological repositories,
 where the contents can be quietly and carefully examined, away from an
 excited and sometimes dangerous crowd.
 In the present case this plan was found impracticable, because the coffin
 was ascertained to be filled with water which had, in 
\begin_inset Marginal

the course of centuries, filtered in, drop by drop, through the interstices
 of the lid.
 The removal to the Capitol was therefore abandoned, not only on account
 of the excessive weight of the coffin, but also because the shaking of
 the water would have damaged and disordered the skeleton and the objects
 which, perchance, were buried inside.

, and decorated with bas-reliefs representing the scene of her death.
 No sooner had the seals been broken, and the lid put aside, than my assistants,
 myself, and the whole crowd of workmen from the Halls of Justice, were
 almost horrified at the sight before us.
 Gazing at the skeleton through the veil of the clear water, we saw the
 skull covered, as it were, with long masses of brown hair, which were floating
 in the liquid crystal.
 The comments made by the simple and excited crowd by which we were surrounded
 were almost as interesting as the discovery itself.
 The news concerning the prodigious hair spread like wild-fire among the
 populace of the district; and so the exhumation of Crepereia Tryphaena
 was accomplished with unexpected solemnity, and its remembrance will last
 for many years in the popular traditions of the new quarter of the Prati
 di Castello.
 The mystery of the hair is easily explained.
 Together with the spring-water, germs or seeds of an aquatic plant had
 entered the sarcophagus, settled on the convex surface of the skull, and
 developed into long glossy threads of a dark shade.

 Where the left hand had been lying, we found four rings of solid gold.
 One is an engagement-ring, with an engraving in red jasper representing
 two hands clasped together.

 Proceeding further with our exploration, we discovered, close to the right
 hip, a box containing toilet articles.
 The box was made of thin pieces of hard wood, inlaid

, with lines, squares, circles, triangles, and diamonds, of bone, ivory,
 and wood of various kinds and colors.
 The box, however, had been completely disjointed by the action of the water.
 Inside there were two fine combs in excellent preservation, with the teeth
 larger on one side than on the other: a small mirror of polished steel,
 a silver box for cosmetics, an amber hairpin, an oblong piece of soft leather,
 and a few fragments of a sponge.

 I have had the opportunity of examining the contents of twelve of them,
 lately discovered.
 These include sponges, combs of various kinds and shapes, hairpins, wooden

 The most impressive discovery was made after the removal of the water,
 and the drying of the coffin.
 The woman had been buried in a shroud of fine white linen, pieces of which
 were still encrusted and cemented against the bottom and sides of the case,
 and she had been laid with a wreath of myrtle fastened with a silver clasp
 about the forehead.
 The preservation of the leaves is truly remarkable.

 was this woman, whose sudden and unexpected reappearance among us on the
 twelfth of May, 1889, created such a sensation? When did she live? At what
 age did she die? What caused her death? What was her condition in life?
 Was she beautiful? Why was she buried with her doll? The careful examination
 of the tomb and its contents enable us to answer all these questions satisfacto
rily.

Crepereia Tryphaena lived at the beginning of the third century after Christ,
 during the reigns of Septimius Severus and Caracalla, as is shown by the
 form of the letters and the style of the bas-reliefs engraved on the sarcophagu
s.
 She was not noble by birth; her Greek surname

 shows that she belong to a family of freedmen, former servants of the noble
 family of the Creperei.
 We know nothing about her features, except that she had a strong and fine
 set of teeth.
 Her figure, however, seems to have been rather defective, on account of
 a deformity in the ribs, probably caused by scrofula.
 Scrofula, in fact, seems to have been the cause of her death.
 In spite of this deformity, however, there is no doubt that she was betrothed
 to the young man Philetus, whose name is engraved on the stone of the second
 ring, and that the two happy lovers had exchanged the oath of fidelity
 and mutual devotion for life, which is expressed by the symbol of the clasped
 hands.
 The story of her sad death, and of the sudden grief which overtook her
 family on the eve of a joyful wedding, is plainly told by the presence
 in the coffin of the doll and the myrtle wreath, which is a

, a work of art in itself, is of oak, to which the combined action of time
 and water has given the hardness of metal.
 It is modelled in perfect imitation of woman's form, and ranks among the
 finest of its kind yet found in Roman excavations.
 The hands and feet are carved with the most skill.
 The arrangement of the hair is characteristic of the age of the Antonines,
 and differs but little from the coiffure of Faustina the elder.
 The doll was probably dressed, because in the thumb of her right hand are
 inserted two gold keyrings like those carried by housewives.
 This charming little figure, the joints of which at the hips, knees, shoulders,
 and elbows are still in good order, is nearly a

 Dolls and playthings are not peculiar to children's tombs.
 It was customary for young ladies to offer their dolls to Venus or Diana
 on their wedding-day.
 She was doomed to share the sad fate of her young mistress, and to be placed
 with her corpse, before the marriage ceremony could be performed.
