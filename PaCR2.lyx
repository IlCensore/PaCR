 Alexander the Great at Kyme; medallions of eminent men; a collection of

The Temple of Apollo was by no means the only sacred museum of ancient Rome;

Pliny the Elder never actually praises the Temple of Concord.
 In addition to a passing mention of it in Book 33, he mentions it many
 times (search for Concord in Books 34 and 35 mostly, but also in Books
 36 and 37) but each time not for its own beauty: rather — and that is really
 our author's point — for the many extraordinary works of art housed there.
 Even then, Pliny does not go into much detail about these sculptures and
 paintings, nor get that enthusiastic, preferring dry enumeration much in
 the style of a list of links on the Web.

 This temple, built by Camillus, at the foot of the Capitol, and restored
 by Tiberius and Septimius Severus, was still standing at the time of Pope
 Hadrian I.
 (772--795), when the inscription on its front was copied for the last time
 by the Einsiedlensis.
 It was razed to the ground towards 1450.

 The platform of the temple and a few fragments of its architectural decorations
 were discovered in 1817.
 The reader may appreciate the grace of these decorations, from a fragment
 of the entablature now in the portico of the Tabularium, and one of the
 capitals of the cella, now in the Palazzo dei Conservatori.
 The cella contained one central and ten side niches, in which eleven masterpiec
es of Greek chisels were placed, namely, the Apollo and Hero, by Baton;
 Leto nursing Apollo and Artemis, by Euphranor; Asklepios and Hygieia, by
 Nikeratos; Ares and Hermes, by Piston; and Zeus, Athena, and Demeter, by
 Sthennis.
 The name of the sculptor of the Concordia in the apse is not known.
 Pliny speaks also of a picture by Theodoros, representing Cassandra; of
 four elephants, cut in obsidian, a miracle of skill and labor, and of a
 collection of precious stones, among which was the sardonyx set in the
 legendary ring of Polykrates of Samos.
 Most of these treasures had been offered to the goddess by Augustus, moved
 by the liberality which Julius Caesar had shown towards his ancestral goddess,
 Venus Genetrix.
 We know from Pliny, 
\noun on
xxxv
\noun default
.9, that Caesar was the first to give due honor to paintings, by exhibiting
 them in his Forum Julium.
 He gave about $72,000 (eighty talents), for two works of Timomachos, representi
ng Medea and Ajax.
 At the base of the Temple of Venus Genetrix he placed his own equestrian
 statue, the horse of which, modelled by Lysippos, had once supported the
 figure of Alexander the Great.
 The statue of Venus was the work of Arkesilaos, and her breast was covered
 with strings of British pearls.
 Pliny (

.5), after mentioning the collection of gems made by Scaurus, and another
 made by Mithradates, which Pompey the Great had offered to Jupiter Capitolinus,
 adds:

 composed of thirty-six pearls and eighteen emeralds, two clasps, two rings
 on the little finger, one on the third, one on the middle finger; and many
 other gems on the shoes, ankles, and wrists.
 Another inscription discovered at Constantine, Algeria, describes a statue
 of Jupiter dedicated in the Capitol of that city.
 The devotees had placed on his head an oak-wreath of silver, with thirty
 leaves and fifteen acorns; they had loaded his right hand with a silver
 disk, a Victory waving a palm-leaf, and a crown of forty leaves; and in
 the other had fastened a silver rod and other emblems.

 There is no other explanation to be given, inasmuch as the structures were

 As for the disfiguration of sacred buildings with all sorts of hangings,

The meaning of this tariff will be easily understood if we recall the details
 of a Graeco-Roman sacrifice, in regard to the apportionment of the victim's
 flesh.
 The parts which were the perquisite of the priests differ in different
 worships; sometimes we hear of legs and skin, sometimes of tongue and shoulder.
 In the case of private sacrifices the rest of the animal was taken home
 by the sacrificer, to be used for a meal or sent as a present to friends.
 This was, of course, impossible in the case of

 When both surfaces were filled, and no room was left for the daily influx

During these last years I have been present at the discovery of five deposits

 The first was found in March, 1876, on the site of a temple of Hercules,
 outside the Porta S.
 Lorenzo; the second in the spring of 1885, on the site of the Temple of
 Diana Nemorensis; the third in 1886, near the Island of Aesculapius (now

 last in 1889, on the site of the Temple of Juno at Veii.

The excavation of the temple of Diana Nemorensis was undertaken in 1885,
 by Sir John Savile Lumley, now Lord Savile of Rutherford, the English ambassado
r at Rome, with the kind consent of the Italian government.
 It seems that this 
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Plain Layout

 was not only a place of worship and devotion, but also a hydro-therapeutic
 establishment.
 The waters employed for the cure were those which spring from the lava
 rocks at Nemi, and which, until a few years ago, fell in graceful cascades
 into the lake, at a place called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 They now supply the city of Albano, which has long suffered from water-famine.
 I can vouch for their therapeutic efficiency from personal experience;
 in fact I could honestly put up my votive offering to the long-forgotten
 goddess, having recovered health and strength by following the old cure.
 Diana, however, was chiefly worshipped in this place as Diana Lucina.
 I need not enter into particulars on this subject.
 The ex-votos collected in large quantity by Lord Savile, representing young
 mothers nursing their first-born, and other offerings of the same nature,
 testify to the skill of the priests.
 Perhaps they practised other branches of surgery, because, among the curiositie
s brought to light in 1885, are several figures with large openings on the
 front through which the intestines are seen.
 Professor Tommasi-Crudeli, who has made a study of this class of curiosities,
 says that they cannot be considered as real anatomical models, because
 the work is too rough and primitive to enable us to distinguish one intestine
 from the other.
 The number of objects collected by Lord Savile may be estimated at three
 thousand.

Characteristic objects of a like nature — breasts cut open and showing the

 It seems that the street leading from the Campus Martius to the Pons Fabricius,

 In the foundations of the new quays of the Tiber, above and below the bridge,

 but the monument which bears it, a nymphaeum of the gardens of the Licinii,
 near the Porta Maggiore, has no connection whatever with the goddess of
 wisdom.
 Minerva Medica was the name of a street on the Esquiline, so called from
 a shrine which stood at the crossing, or near the crossing, with the Via
 Merulana, not far from the church of SS.
 Pietro e Marcellino.
 Its foundations and its deposit of ex-votos were discovered in 1887.
 The shape and nature of the offerings bear witness to numberless cases
 of recovery performed by the merciful goddess, the Athena Hygieia or Paionia
 of the Greeks.
 There is a fragment of a lamp inscribed with her name, which leaves no
 doubt as to the identity of the deposit.
 There is also a votive head, not cast from the mould, but modelled

, which alludes to Minerva as a restorer of hair.
 The scalp is covered with thick hair in front and on the top, while the
 sides are bald, or showing only an incipient growth.
 It is evident, therefore, that the woman whose portrait-head we have found
 had lost her curls in the course of some malady, and having regained them
 through the intercession of Minerva, as she piously believed, offered her
 this curious token of gratitude.
 This, at least, is Visconti's opinion.
 Another testimonial of Minerva's efficiency in restoring hair has been
 found at Piacenza, a votive tablet put up

 Upon this, the Rome soldiers burst through the floor, seized the entrails

 with his own hand, while his followers were gaining possession of the city.
 The account is certainly more or less fabricated; but, as Livy remarks,

; but at Veii, because of the danger and the difficulty of excavating them
 within the citadel, and in solid rock, the ex-votos were carted away and
 thrown from the edge of the cliff into the valley below.
 The place selected was the north side of the rocky ridge connecting the
 citadel with the city, which ridge towers one hundred and ninety-eight
 above the cañon of the Cremera.
 The mass of objects thrown over here in the course of centuries has produced
 a slope which reaches nearly to the top of the cliff.
 The reader will appreciate the importance of the deposit from the fact
 that the mine has been exploited ever since the time of Alexander VII.
 (1665--1667); and in the spring of 1889, when the most recent excavations
 were made, by the late empress Theresa of Brazil, the mass of terra-cottas
 brought up to the surface was such that work had to be given up after a
 few days, because there was no more space in the farmhouse for the storage
 of the booty.
 Pietro Sante Bartoli left an account of the excavations made on the same
 spot by cardinal Chigi, during the pontificate of Alexander VII.
 Modern topographers do not seem to be aware of this fact; it is not mentioned
 by Dennis, or Gell, or Nibby, although it is the only evidence left of
 the discovery of the famous sanctuary.

 a ram and a sow, and although the panels lie scattered around the temple,

When the farms of Isola Farnese and Vaccareccia, in which the remains of
 Veii and of its extensive cemeteries are situated, were sold, a few years
 ago, by the empress of Brazil to the marchese Ferraioli, the parties concerned
 agreed that the right of excavating and the objects discovered should belong
 to her, for a limited number of years, up to 1891, I believe.
 The first campaign, opened January 2, 1889, and closed in June, must be
 considered as one of the most valuable contributions to the study of Etruscan
 civilization which have been supplied of late to students, either by chance
 or by design.
 Had the empress been able to carry out her plans for two or three years
 more, the whole city and necropolis would have been explored, surveyed,
 and illustrated, in the most strictly scientific manner.
 Political events and the death of this noble woman brought the enterprise
 to a close.
 To come back, however, to the bed of votive objects in terra-cotta and
 bronze, I was able to make a rough estimate of its dimensions, which are
 two hundred and fifty feet in length, fifty feet in width, and from three
 to four in depth; nearly forty-four thousand cubic feet.

 The voice was attributed to a local Genius, whom the people named Aius
 Loquens or Locutius.
 As a rule, the priests refrained from mentioning in public prayers the
 name and sex of new and slightly known divinities, especially of local
 Genii, to which they objected for two reasons: first, because there was
 danger of vitiating the ceremony by a false invocation; secondly, because
 it was prudent not to reveal the true name of these tutelary gods to the
 enemy of the commonwealth, lest in case of war or siege he could force
 them to abandon the defence of that special place, by mysterious and violent
 rites.

 place over nineteen hundred years ago, and was attended by the most illustrious

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The origin of the saecular games seems to be this: In the early days of
 Rome the northwest section of the Campus Martius, bordering on the Tiber,
 was conspicuous for traces of volcanic activity.
 There was a pool here called Tarentum or Terentum, fed by hot sulphur springs,
 the efficiency of which is attested by the cure of Volesus, the Sabine,
 and his family, described by Valerius Maximus.
 Heavy vapors hung over the springs, and tongues of flame were seen issuing
 from the cracks of the earth.
 The locality became known by the name of the fiery field (
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\backslash

\end_inset

), and its relationship with the infernal realms was soon an established
 fact in folk-lore.
 An altar to the infernal gods was erected on the borders of the pool, and
 games were held periodically in honor of Dis and Proserpina, the victims
 being a black bull and a black cow.
 Tradition attributed this arrangement of time and ceremony to Volesus himself,
 who, grateful for the recovery of his three children, offered sacrifices
 to Dis and Proserpina, spread

 and celebrated games for three nights, one for each child which had been

 In the republican epoch they were called

 These calamities being contingencies which no man could foresee, it is

What was the exact location of the sulphur springs, the Tarentum, and the
 altar of the infernal gods? I have reason to regard the discovery of the
 Altar of Dis and Proserpina as the most satisfactory I have made, especially
 because I made it, if I may so express myself, when away from Rome on a
 long leave of absence.
 It took place in the winter of 1886--87, during my visit to America.
 At that time the work of opening and draining the Corso Vittorio Emanuele
 had just reached a place which was considered 
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Plain Layout

 by the topographers, and indicated by a blank spot in the archaeological
 maps of the city.
 I mean the district between the Vallicella (la Chiesa Nuova, the Palazzo
 Cesarini, etc.) and the banks of the Tiber near S.
 Giovanni dei Fiorentini.
 The reports spoke vaguely about the discovery of five or six parallel walls,
 built of blocks of peperino, of marble steps in the centre of this singular
 monument, of gates with marble posts and architraves, leading to the spaces
 between the six parallel walls, and finally, of a column with foliage carved
 upon its surface.
 On my return to Rome, in the spring of 1887, every trace of the monument
 had disappeared under the embankment of the Corso Vittorio Emanuele.
 I questioned foremen and workmen, I consulted the notebooks of the contractors,
 every day I visited the excavations which were still in progress, on each
 side of the Corso, for building the Cavalletti and Bassi palaces, and lastly,
 I examined the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

column with foliage carved upon its surface,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 which in the mean time had been removed to the courtyard of the Palazzo
 dei Conservatori on the Capitol.
 This marble fragment, the only one saved from the excavations, gave me
 the clue to the mystery.
 It was not a column, it was a

 discovered under the Palazzo Fiano, with that of the Antonines discovered

 There was then no hesitation in determining the nature of the discoveries
 made in the Corso Vittorio Emanuele; an altar had been found there, and
 this altar must have been the one sacred to Dis and Proserpina, as no other
 is mentioned in history in the northwest section of the Campus Martius.

 The vow was, however, forgotten until Domitian claimed its fulfilment some

 The following inscription has been found engraved on two of them: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

This sacred area, marked with stone cippi, and enclosed with a hedge, as
 well as the altar which stands in the middle of it, was dedicated by the
 emperor Domitian in consequence of an unfulfilled vow made by the citizens
 at the time of the fire of Nero.
 The dedication is made subject to the following rules: that no one shall
 be allowed to loiter, trade, build, or plant trees or shrubs within the
 line of terminal stones; that on August 23 of each year, the day of the
 Volkanalia, the magistrate presiding over this sixth region shall sacrifice
 on this altar a red calf and a pig; that he shall address to the gods the

 Its discovery was due more to an intuition of the truth, than to actual
 recognition of existing remains.
 On November 7, 1875, while digging for the foundation of the new Rotunda
 in the garden which divides the Conservatori palace from that of the Caffarelli
s, — the residence of the German ambassador, — our workmen came upon a piece
 of colossal fluted column of Pentelic marble, lying on a platform of squared
 stones, which were laid without mortar, in a decidedly archaic style.
 Were we in the presence of the remains of the famous Capitolium, or of
 one of the smaller temples within the Arx? To give this query a satisfactory
 answer, we must remember that the Capitoline Hill had two summits, one
 containing the citadel, or Arx, the other the Temple of Jupiter Optimus
 Maximus, the Capitolium.
 Ancient writers never use the two names promiscuously, or apply them indifferen
tly to either summit or to the whole hill.
 The name of the hill is the

For many generations topographers tried to discover which summit was occupied
 by the citadel, and which by the temple.
 The Italian school, save a few exceptions, had always identified the site
 of the Aracoeli with that of the temple, the Caffarelli palace with that
 of the citadel.
 The Germans upheld the opposite theory.
 In these circumstances it is not surprising that the discovery made November
 7, 1875 should have excited us; because we saw at once our chance of settling
 the dispute, not theoretically, but with the evidence of facts.

 In June, 455, the Vandals, under Genseric, plundered the sanctuary, its

 half the roof was stripped of its gilt bronze tiles.
 From that time the place was used as a stone-quarry and lime-kiln to such
 an extent that only the solitary fragment of a column remains on the spot
 to tell the long tale of destruction.
 Another piece of Pentelic marble was found January 24, 1889, near the Tullianum

There is one interesting feature of the Capitolium, which is not well known
 among those who do not make a profession of archaeology.
 It was used as a place for advertising State acts, deeds, and documents,
 in order that the public might take notice of them and be informed of what
 was going on in the administrative, military, and political departments.
 This fact is known from a clause appended to imperial letters-patent by
 which veterans were honorably discharged from the army or navy, and privileges
 bestowed on them in recognition of their services.
 These deeds, known as 
\begin_inset ERT

\end_layout

\end_inset

, were engraved on bronze tablets shaped like the cover of a book, the original
 of which was hung somewhere in the Capitolium, and a copy taken by the
 veteran to his home.
 The originals are all gone, having fallen the prey of the plunderers of
 bronze in Rome, but copies are found in great numbers in every province
 of the Roman empire from which men were drafted.

The Temple of Isis and Serapis
\noun default
.
 In the spring of 1883, in surveying the tract of ground between the Collegio
 Romano and the Baths of Agrippa, formerly occupied by the Temple of Isis
 and Serapis, and in collecting archaeological information concerning it,
 I was struck by the fact that, every time excavations were made on either
 side of the Via di S.
 Ignazio for building or restoring the houses which line it, remarkable
 specimens of Egyptian art had been brought to light.
 The annals of discoveries begin with 1374, when the obelisk now in the
 Piazza della Rotonda was found, under the apse of the church of S.
 Maria sopra Minerva, together with the one now in the Villa Mattei von
 Hoffman.
 In 1435, Eugenius IV.
 discovered the two lions of Nektaneb I which are now in the Vatican, and
 the two of black basalt now in the Capitoline Museum.
 In 1440 the reclining figure of a river-god was found and buried again.
 The Tiber of the Louvre and the Nile of the Braccio Nuovo seem to have
 come to light during the pontificate of Leo X; at all events it was he
 who caused them to be removed to the Vatican.
 In 1556 Giovanni Battista de Fabi found, and sold to cardinal Farnese,
 the reclining statue of Oceanus now in Naples.
 In 1719 the Isiac altar now in the Capitol was found under the Biblioteca
 Casanatense.
 In 1858 Pietro Tranquilli, in restoring his house, — the nearest to the
 apse of la Minerva, — came across the following-named objects: a sphinx
 of green granite, the head of which is a portrait of Queen Haths'epu, the
 oldest sister of Thotmes III., who was famous for her expedition to the
 Red Sea, recently described by Dümmichen;

 a sphinx of red granite, believed to be a Roman replica; a group of the
 cow Hathor, the living symbol of Isis, nursing the young Pharaoh Horemheb;
 the portrait statue of the grand dignitary Uahábra, a good specimen of
 Saïtic art; a column of the temple, covered with high reliefs, which represente
d a procession of bald-headed priests holding canopi in their hands; a capital,
 carved with papyrus leaves and lotus flowers; and a fragment of an Egyptian
 basrelief in red granite, with traces of polychromy.

In 1859 Augusto Silvestrelli, the owner of the next house, on the same side
 of the Via di S.
 Ignazio, found five capitals of the same style and size, which, I believe,
 are now in the Museo Etrusco Gregoriano.
 Inasmuch as no excavation had ever been made under the pavement of the
 street itself, which is public property, and as there was no reason why
 that strip of public property should not contain as many works of art as
 the houses about it, I asked the municipal authorities to try the experiment,
 and my proposal was accepted at once.

 between houses of very doubtful solidity.
 First to appear, at the end of the third day, was a magnificent sphinx
 of black basalt, the portrait of King Amasis.
 It is a masterpiece of the Saïtic school, perfected even in the smallest
 details, and still more impressive for its historical connection with the

The cartouches bearing the king's name appear to have been purposely erased,

 The nose, likewise, and the

, the symbol of royalty, were hammered away at the same time.
 The explanation of these facts is given by Herodotos.
 When Cambyses conquered Saïs, Amasis had just been buried.
 The conqueror caused the body to be dragged out of the royal tomb, then
 flogged and otherwise insulted, and finally burnt, the maximum of profanation,
 from an Egyptian point of view.
 His name was erased from the monuments which bore it, as a natural consequence
 of the

 This sphinx is the surviving testimonial of the eventful catastrophe.
 When, six or seven centuries later, a Roman governor of Egypt, or a Roman
 merchant from the same province, singled out this work of art, to be shipped
 to Rome as a votive offering for the Temple of Isis, ignorant of the historical
 value of its mutilations, he had the nose and the

 Now both are gone again, and there is no danger of a second restoration.
 I may remark, as a curious coincidence, that, as the name of Amasis is
 erased from the sphinx, so that of Hophries, his predecessor, is erased
 from the obelisk discovered in the same temple, and now in the Piazza della

The second work, discovered June 17, was an obelisk which was wonderfully
 well preserved to the very top of the pinnacle, and covered with hieroglyphics.
 It was quarried at Assuan, from a richly colored vein of red granite, and
 was brought to Rome, probably under Domitian, together with the obelisk
 now in the Piazza del Pantheon.
 The two monoliths are almost identical in size and workmanship, and are
 inscribed with the same cartouches of Rameses the Great.
 The one which I discovered was set up, in 1887, to the memory of our brave
 soldiers who fell at the battle of Dogali.
 The site selected for the monument, the square between the railway station
 and the Baths of Diocletian, is too large for such a comparatively small

, and also the obelisk, were certainly seen in 1719 by the masons who built
 the foundations of the Biblioteca Casanatense.
 For some reason unknown to us, they kept their discovery a secret.
 Many other works of art were discovered before the close of the excavations,
 in the last days of June.
 Among them were a crocodile in red granite, the pedestal of a candelabrum,
 triangular in shape, with sphinxes at the corners; a column of the temple,
 with reliefs representing an Isiac procession; and a portion of a capital.
 From an architectural point of view, the most curious discovery was that
 the temple itself, with its colonnades and double cella, had been brought
 over, piece by piece, from the banks of the Nile to those of the Tiber.
 It is not an imitation; it is a purely original Egyptian structure, shaded
 first by the palm-trees of Saïs, and later by the pines of the Campus Martius.

 Pharaohs, gods, priests, dignitaries, and Pastophoroi were hurled from
 their pedestals, and broken to pieces.
 When this wholesale destruction took place, the pavement of the temple
 was still clear of the rubbish and loose soil.
 The sphinx of Amasis, found June 14, was lying on its left side on the
 bare pavement; the two apes had fallen on their backs.
 No attempt, however, was made to overthrow the obelisks, at least the one
 which I discovered.

Students have wondered at the existence, in our time, of such a mine of
 antiquities in this quarter of the Campus Martius, where it appears as
 if, in spite of the feverish search for ancient marbles, this spot had
 escaped the attention of the excavators of the past four or five centuries.
 It did not escape their attention.
 The whole area of the Iseum, save a few recesses, has been explored since
 the Middle Ages, but the search was made to secure marble, which could
 be burnt into lime, or turned into new shapes.
 Of what use would porphyry, or granite, or basalt be for such purposes?
 These materials are useless for the lime-kiln, and too hard to be worked
 anew, and accordingly they were left alone.
 In the excavations of 1883 I found the best evidence that such was the
 case.
 The obelisk is of granite; its pedestal of white marble.
 The obelisk escaped destruction, but the pedestal was split, and made ready
 for the lime-kiln.

 he had gained over the foes of the commonwealth; but the beautiful ruins

 They belong to the restoration of the temple which was made by Hadrian

 80, by which the Neptunium, or Poseidonion, was nearly destroyed.
 The characteristic feature of the temple was a set of thirty-six bas-reliefs
 representing the thirty-six provinces of the Roman Empire at the beginning
 of the Christian era.
 These reliefs were set into the basement of the temple, so as to form the
 pedestals of the thirty-six columns of the peristyle, while the intercolumniati
ons, or spaces between the pedestals, were occupied by another set of bas-relief
s representing the military uniforms, flags and weapons which were peculiar
 to each of the provinces.
 The fifteen provinces and fourteen trophies belonging to the colonnade
 of the Piazza di Pietra, that is, to the north side of the temple, have
 all been accounted for.
 Four provinces were found during the pontificate of Paul III.
 (1534--50), two during that of Innocent X.
 (1644--55), two during that of Alexander VII.
 (1655--1667), three in our excavations of 1878, and four either are still
 in the ground or have perished in a lime-kiln.
 Here again we have an instance of the shameful dispersion of the spoils
 of ancient Rome.
 We have this wing of the temple still standing in all its glory, in the
 Piazza di Pietra; we have eleven pedestals out of fifteen, and as many
 panels for the intercolumniations; the others are probably within our reach,
 and we have beautiful pieces of the entablature with its rich carvings.
 The temple, entablature, and nearly all the trophies and provinces are
 public property; nothing would be easier than to restore each piece to
 its proper place, and make this wing of the Neptunium one of the most perfect
 relics of ancient Rome.
 Alas! three provinces and two trophies have emigrated to Naples with the
 rest of the Farnese marbles, one has been left behind in the portico of
 the Farnese palace in Rome, five provinces and four trophies are in the
 Palazzo dei Conservatori, two are in the Palazzo Odescalchi, one is in

 seat in the Giardino delle Tre Pile on the Capitol, and another has been

 forcibly struck their fancy.
 The fashion died out in course of time, but never entirely.
 Some of these more or less fanciful structures still live in our books,
 and in the imagination of the people.
 The place of honor, in this line, belongs to Caligula's bridge, which is
 supposed to have crossed the valley of the Forum at a prodigious height,
 so as to enable the young monarch to walk on a level from his Palatine
 house to the Temple of Jupiter on the Capitol.
 This bridge is not only mentioned in guide-books, and pointed out to strangers
 on their first visit to the Forum, but is also drawn and described in works
 of a higher standard,

Writing 13 years after Lanciani, Christian Hülsen still believed in the
 existence of this bridge, to the point of attributing some masonry to one
 of its piers (Il Foro Romano, Section XXIX); and yet another 24 years after

The bridge never existed.
 Caligula made use of the roofs of edifices which were already there, spanning
 only the gaps of the streets with temporary wooden passages.

 The Street of Victory which divided the emperor's palace from the Temple

The position of Caligula's palace at the northeast corner of the Palatine
 being well known, as also the site of the Basilica Julia, it is evident
 that the building which stands between the two must be the Temple of Augustus.
 This conclusion is so simple that I wonder that no one had mentioned it
 before my first announcement in 1881.
 The last nameless remains adjoining the Forum have thus regained their
 place and their identity in the topography of this classic quarter.

The construction of a temple in honor of the deified founder of the empire
 was begun by his widow Livia, and Tiberius, his adopted son, and completed
 by Caligula.
 An inscription discovered in 1726, in the Columbaria of Livia on the Appian
 Way, mentions a C.
 Julius Bathyllus, sacristan or keeper of the temple.
 Pliny (

 of extraordinary size, placed by Livia on a golden tray.
 The relic was destroyed by fire in the reign of Titus.
 Domitian must have restored the building, because the rear wall of the
 temple, the

 It has been excavated but once, in June, 1549, when the Forum, the Sacra
 Via and the Street of the Tuscans were ransacked to supply marbles for
 the building of S.
 Peter's.

 island of S.
 Bartolomeo as sacred to the latter.

 are realistic rather than conventional.
 Both hands are missing, so that it is impossible to state what were the
