 A great many have disappeared since the first institution, and are known
 only from ruins, or inscriptions and chronicles.
 Others have been disfigured by "restorations." Without denying the fact
 that our sacred buildings excel in quantity rather than quality, there
 is no doubt that as a whole they form the best artistic and historic collection
 in the world.
 Every age, from the apostolic to the present, every school, every style
 has its representatives in the churches of Rome.

\begin_layout Standard
The assertion that the works of mediaeval architects have been destroyed
 or modernized to such an extent as to leave a wide gap between the classic
 and Renaissance periods, must have been made by persons unacquainted with
 Rome; the churches and the cloisters of S.
 Saba on the Aventine, of SS.
 Quattro Coronati on the Caelian, of S.
 Giovanni a Porta Latina, of SS.
 Vincenzo e Anastasio alle Tre Fontane, of S.
 Lorenzo fuori le Mura, are excellent specimens of mediaeval architecture.
 Let students, archaeologists, and architects provide themselves with a
 chronological table of our sacred buildings, and select the best specimens
 for every quarter of a century, beginning with the oratory of Aquila and
 Prisca, mentioned in the Epistles, and ending with the latest contemporary
 creations; they cannot find a better subject for their education in art
 and history.

From the point of view of their origin and structure, the churches of Rome

In treating this subject we must bear in mind that early Christian edifices
 in Rome were never named from the owner of the property on which they were
 established.
 The same rule applies to the suburban cemeteries, which were always named
 from the owner of the ground above them, not from the martyrs buried within.
 The statement is simple; but we are so accustomed to calling the Lateran

In the familiar record of the first days of the Christian church we read
 how the men of Galilee, who returned to Jerusalem after the ascension,
 `went up into the upper chamber,' which was at once their dwelling-place
 and their house of prayer and of assembly.
 There, at the first common meal, the bread was broken and the cup passed
 around in remembrance of the last occasion on which they had sat at table
 with Christ.
 There too they assembled for their first act of church government, the
 election of a successor to the apostate Judas.
 All is simple and domestic, yet we have here the beginnings of what became
 in time the most wide-reaching and highly organized of human systems.
 An elaborate hierarchy, a complicated theology were to arise out of the
 informal conclave, the memorial meal; and in like manner, out of the homely
 meeting-place of the disciples would be developed the costly and beautiful
 forms of the Christian temple.

Rome possesses authentic remains of the "houses of prayer" in which the
 gospel was first announced in apostolic times.
 Five names are mentioned in connection with the visit of Peter and Paul
 to the capital of the empire, and two houses are mentioned as those in
 which they found hospitality, and were able to preach the new doctrine.
 One of these, belonging to Pudens and his daughters Pudentiana and Praxedes,
 stands halfway up the Vicus Patricius (Via del Bambin Gesù) on the southern
 slope of the Viminal; the other, belonging to Aquila and Prisca (or Priscilla),
 on the spur of the Aventine which overlooks the Circus Maximus.
 Both have been represented through the course of centuries, and are represented
 now, by a church, named from the owner the

 Archaeologists have tried to trace the genealogy of Pudens, the friend
 of the apostles; but, although it seems probable that he belonged to the
 noble race of the Cornelii Aemilii, the fact has not yet been clearly proved.
 Equally doubtful are the origin and social condition of Aquila and his
 wife Prisca, whose names appear both in the Acts and in the Epistles.
 We know from these documents that, in consequence of the decree of banishment
 which was issued against the Jews by the emperor Claudius, Aquila and Prisca
 were compelled to leave Rome for a while, and that on their return they
 were able to open a small oratory —

 — in their house.
 This oratory, one of the first opened to divine worship in Rome, these
 walls which, in all probability, have echoed with the sound of S.
 Peter's voice, were discovered in 1776 close to the modern church of S.
 Prisca; but no attention was paid to the discovery, in spite of its unrivalled
 importance.
 The only memorandum of it is a scrap of paper in Codex 9697 of the Bibliothèque
 Nationale in Paris, in which a man named Carrara speaks of having found
 a subterranean chapel near S.
 Prisca, decorated with paintings of the fourth century, representing the
 apostles.
 A copy of these frescoes seems to have been made at the time, but no trace
 of it has been found.
 I cannot understand how, in an age like ours, so enthusiastically devoted
 to archaeological, historical, and religious research, no attempt has since
 been made to bring this venerable oratory to light.

In the same excavations of 1776 was found a bronze tablet, which had been
 offered to Gaius Marius Pudens Cornelianus, by the people of Clunia (near
 Palencia, Spain) as a token of gratitude for the services which he had
 rendered them during his governorship of the province of Tarragona.
 The tablet, dated April 9,

 222, proves that the house owned by Aquila and Prisca in apostolic times
 had subsequently passed into the hands of a Cornelius Pudens; in other
 words, that the relations formed between the two families during the sojourn
 of the apostles in Rome had been faithfully maintained by their descendants.
 Their intimate connection is also proved by the fact that Pudens, Pudentiana,
 Praxedes, and Prisca were all buried in the Cemetery of Priscilla on the
 Via Salaria.

 The tradition deserves attention because it was openly accepted at the

 The name of the church at that time was simply Ecclesia Pudentiana, which

 In course of time the ignorant people changed the word Pudentiana, a possessive

 the place of the genuine one.

The connection of the house with the apostolate of SS.
 Peter and Paul made it very popular from the beginning.
 Laymen and clergymen alike contributed to transform it into a handsome

 Pope Siricius (384--397), his acolytes Leopardus, Maximus and Ilicius,
 and Valerius Messalla, prefect of the city (396--403), ornamented it with
 mosaics, colonnades, and marble screens, and built on the west side of

While Francesco Volterra was restoring the church of S.
 Pudentiana, and building the foundations of the dome, the masons discovered
 a marble group of the Laocoön, broken into many pieces.
 Whether from ill will or from laziness, they left the beautiful work of
 art at the bottom of the trench, and brought to the surface only a leg,
 without the foot, and a wrist.
 It was given to me, and I used to show it with pride to my artist friends,
 until some one stole it.
 It was a replica of the Belvedere group, considerably larger, and so beautiful
 that many believe it to be the original described by Pliny (

 The ancients, like the moderns, were fond of reproducing masterpieces.
 If the replica of the Pietà of Michelangelo, which we admire in the church
 of S.
 Maria dell' Anima, had been found under the ground, would we not consider
 it a better work than the original in S.
 Peter's? Francesco Volterra complained to me many times about the slovenliness
 of the masons; he says that, working by contract (

 increased in numbers and the space became inadequate, the faithful were
 compelled to occupy that section of the portico which was in front of the
 meeting hall.
 When the congregation became still larger, there was no other way of accommodat

 Oratories and churches built over the tombs of martyrs and confessors
\noun default
.
 The sacred buildings of this class are, or were formerly, outside the walls,
 as burial was not allowed within city limits.
 To explain their origin and to understand their significance we must bear
 in mind the following rules.
 The action of the Roman law towards the Christians, that is, towards persons
 accused of atheism and rebellion against the Empire, resulted in the execution
 of those who were convicted.
 Except in extraordinary cases, the body of the victim could be claimed
 by relatives and friends and buried with due honors.
 In chapters vi.
 and vii.
 instances will be quoted of the erection of imposing tombs to the memory
 of Roman patricians, generals and magistrates, who were put to death under
 the imperial régime.
 The same privileges of burial were granted to the Christians, who preferred,
 however, the modesty and safety of a grave in the heart of the catacombs
 to the pompous luxury of a mausoleum above ground.
 The grave of a martyr was an object of consideration, and was often visited
 by pilgrims, who adorned it with wreaths and lights on the anniversary
 of his execution.
 After the end of the persecutions the first thought of the victorious church
 was to honor the memory of those who had fought so gallantly for the common
 cause, and who at the sacrifice of their lives had hastened the advent
 of the days of freedom and peace.
 No better altar than those graves could be chosen for the celebration of
 divine service; but they were sunk deep in the ground, and the cubicula
 of the catacombs were hardly capable of containing the officiating clergy,
 much less the multitudes of the faithful.
 Touching the graves, removing them to a more suitable place, was out of
 the question; in the eyes of the early Christians no more impious sacrilege
 could be perpetrated.
 There was but one way left to deal with the difficulty; that of cutting
 away the rock over and around the grave, and thereby gaining such space
 as was deemed sufficient for the erection of a basilica.
 The excavation was done in conformity with two rules, — that the tomb of
 the martyr should occupy the place of honor in the middle of the apse,
 and that the body of the church should be to the east of the tomb, except
 in cases of

 their existence to the humble grave which no human hand was allowed to

When these graves were not very deep, the floor of the basilica was almost
 level with the ground, as in the case of S.
 Peter's, S.
 Paul's, and S.
 Valentine's; in other cases it was sunk so deep in the heart of the hill
 that only the roof and the upper tier of windows were seen above the ground,
 as in the basilicas of S.

 There are two or three basilicas built, or rather excavated, entirely under

It soon became evident that edifices sunk in such awkward places could hardly

Apparently the works accomplished for the same purpose at S.
 Lorenzo fuori le Mura, by Pope Pelagius II.
 (579--590), were no less important.
 They are described in another poem, a modern copy of which (1860) is to
 be seen on the side of the mosaic in the apsidal arch.
 The poem relates how the hill of Cyriaca was cut away, and how, in consequence
 of the excavation, the church became light, accessible, and free from the
 danger of landslips and inundations.
 The importance of the work of Pelagius is rather exaggerated by the composer
 of the poem.
 The church was never free from dampness and want of air and light until
 the pontificate of Pius IX., who cut away another section of the hill.

The following sketch of the origin of the two leading sacred edifices of
 Rome may answer the scope of the present chapter.
 But let me repeat once again the declaration that I write about the monuments
 of ancient Rome from a strictly archaeological point of view, avoiding
 questions which pertain, or are supposed to pertain, to religious controversy.
 For the archaeologist the presence and execution of SS.
 Peter and Paul in Rome are facts established beyond a shadow of doubt by
 purely monumental evidence.
 There was a time when persons belonging to different creeds made it almost
 a case of conscience to affirm or deny

 This state of feeling is a matter of the past, at least for those who have

 However, if my readers think that I am assuming as proved what they still
 consider subject for discussion, I beg to refer them to some of the standard
 works published on this subject by writers who are above the suspicion
 of partiality.

 the words are full of meaning, if we suppose him to be alluding to the
 personal relations of the two apostles with the Roman Church.
 In fact, the reason for his use of this language is the recognition of
 the visit to Rome of S.
 Peter as well as S.
 Paul, which is persistently maintained in early tradition; and thus it
 is a parallel to the joint mention of the two apostles in 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Clement of Rome
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 (p.

 Döllinger adds: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

That S.
 Peter worked in Rome is a fact so abundantly proved and so deeply imbedded
 in the earliest Christian history, that whoever treats it as a legend ought
 in consistency to treat the whole of the earliest church history as legendary,
 or at least, quite uncertain.
 His presence in Corinth is obviously connected with his journey to Rome,
 and no one will accept the one and deny the other (see Cor.
 i.12; iii.22; xi.22, 23; Clement's Ep.
 47, etc.) Clement again reminds the Corinthians of the `martyrdom of Peter
 and Paul \SpecialChar \ldots{}
 among us,' meaning Rome.
 The very mention implies that S.
 Peter's martyrdom was a well-known fact, and it is inconceivable that his
 execution should have been known and not the place where it occurred, or
 that the place should have been forgotten, and a wrong one substituted
 some years later.
 And when Ignatius writes to the Romans — `I do not command you like Peter
 and Paul; they were apostles' — it is clear, without any explanation, that
 he desires to remind them of the two men who, as founders and teachers,
 had been the glory of the Church.

 Peter having labored at Rome.
 It is inconceivable that the author of the Ebionite document should have
 put forward a groundless fable, about the theatre of S.
 Peter's operations, at a time when many who had seen him must have been
 still alive.
 Eusebius, who had the writings of Papias (and Hegesippos) before him, maintains
 with Clement, that S.
 Peter wrote his Epistle at Rome (Euseb.
 ii.15).
 Papias, a disciple of S.
 John, speaking of this epistle declares that

 in accordance with Irenaeus, who says:

 If we consider that Hegesippos came to Rome to investigate, among other
 things, the succession of local bishops for the short period of eighty-three
 years, that he certainly spoke with persons whose fathers could remember
 the presence of the apostles, we cannot help accepting his evidence as
 conclusive.

The main objection brought forward by the opponents is that, after the incident
 at Antioch, we have no positive knowledge of the actions and travels of
 S.
 Peter.
 Still, there is nothing to contradict the assumption of his journey to
 Rome, and his confession and execution there.
 The fact was so generally known that nobody took the trouble to write a
 precise statement of it, because nobody dreamed that it could be denied.
 How is it possible to imagine that the primitive Church did not know the
 place of the death of its two leading apostles? In default of written testimony
 let us consult monumental evidence.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is no event of the imperial age and of imperial Rome which is attested
 by so many noble structures, all of which point to the same conclusion,
 — the presence and execution of the apostles in the capital of the empire.
 When Constantine raised the monumental basilicas over their tombs on the
 Via Cornelia and the Via Ostiensis; when Eudoxia built the church ad Vincula;
 when Damasus put a memorial tablet in the Platonia ad Catacumbas; when
 the houses of Pudens and Aquila and Prisca were turned into oratories;
 when the name of Nymphae Sancti Petri was given to the springs in the catacombs
 of the Via Nomentana; when the twenty-ninth day of June was accepted as
 the anniversary of S.
 Peter's execution; when Christians and pagans alike all named their children
 Peter and Paul; when sculptors, painters, medallists, goldsmiths, workers
 in glass and enamel, and engravers of precious stones, all began to reproduce
 in Rome the likenesses of the apostles, at the beginning of the second
 century, and continued to do so till the fall of the empire; must we consider
 them all as laboring under a delusion, or as conspiring in the commission
 of a gigantic fraud? Why were such proceedings accepted without protest
 from whatever city, from whatever community, if there were any other which
 claimed to own the genuine tombs of SS.
 Peter and Paul? These arguments gain more value from the fact that the
 evidence on the opposite side is purely negative.
 It is one thing to write of these controversies at a distance from the
 scene of the events, in the seclusion of one's own library; but quite another
 to study them on the spot, and to follow the events where they took place.
 If my readers had the opportunity of witnessing the discoveries made lately
 in the Cemeterium Ostrianum, and the Platonia ad Catacumbas; or of examining
 Grimaldi's manuscripts and drawings relating to the old basilica of Constantine
; or Carrara's account of the discoveries made in 1776 in the house of Aquila
 and Prisca, they would surely banish from their minds the last shade of
 doubt.

The privileges which the Roman law allowed to sepulchres, even of criminals,
 made it possible for the Christians to keep these graves in good order,
 with impunity.
 However, they ran a great risk under Elagabalus.
 Among the many extravagances in which this youth indulged in connection
 with the circus, such as driving a chariot drawn by four camels, or letting
 loose thousands of poisonous snakes among the spectators, Lampridius mentions
 a race of four quadrigae drawn by elephants, which was to be run in the
 Vatican; and as the track inside the circus was obviously too narrow for
 such an attempt, another was prepared outside by removing or destroying
 those tombs of the Via Cornelia which stood in the way.

 This gem of the art of the sixth century was ruthlessly destroyed by Paul

 The eight columns of porphyry, one of which was ornamented with an imperial
 bust in high relief, have disappeared, and so have the bas-reliefs of the

 The bronzes were removed to the garden of the Vatican, but, with the exception
 of the pine-cone and two peacocks, they were doomed to share the fate of
 the marbles.

The most important monument of the atrium, after the fountain, was the tomb
 of the emperor Otho II.
 († 983), or what was believed to be his tomb, as some contemporary writers
 attribute it to Cencio, prefect of Rome, who died 1077.
 The body lay in a marble sarcophagus, which was screened by slabs of serpentine

 Hadrian's mausoleum.
 The mosaic picture above represented the Savior between SS.
 Peter and Paul.
 This historical monument was demolished by Carlo Maderno in the night of
 October 20, 1610.
 The coffin was removed to the Quirinal and turned into a water-trough.
 Grimaldi saw it last, near the entrance gate from the side of the Via dei
 Maroniti.
 The panels of serpentine were used in the new building, the picture of
 the Savior was removed to the Grotte; the cover of porphyry was turned

On entering the nave the visitor was struck by the simplicity of Constantine's
 design, and by the multitude and variety of later additions, by which the
 number of altars alone had been increased from one to sixty-eight.
 Ninety-two columns supported an open roof, the trusses of which were of
 the kingpost pattern.
 In spite of frequent repairs, resulting from fires, decay, and age, some
 of these trusses still bore the mark of Constantine's name.
 They were splendid specimens of timber.

Another work of art deserves attention, because its origin, age, and style
 are still matters of controversy.
 I mean the bronze statue of S.
 Peter (see p.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand pageref
reference "fig3.12_statue_speter"

\end_inset

) placed against the right wall of the nave, near the S.
 Andrew of Francis de Quesnoy.
 Without attempting a discussion which would be inconsistent with the spirit
 of this book, I can safely state that the theories suggested by modern
 Petrographists, from Torrigio to Bartolini, deserve no credit.
 The statue is not the Capitoline Jupiter transformed into an apostle; nor
 was it cast with the bronze of that figure; it never held the thunderbolt
 in the place of the keys of heaven.
 The statue was cast as a portrait of S.
 Peter; the head belongs to the body; the keys and the uplifted fingers
 of the right hand are essential and genuine details of the original composition.
 The difficulty, and it is a great one, consists in stating its age.
 There is no doubt that Christian sculptors modelled excellent portrait-statues
 in the second and third centuries: as is proved by that of Hippolytus (see
 p.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand pageref
reference "fig3.13_statue_hippolytus"

), discovered in 1551 in the Via Tiburtina, and now in the Lateran Museum,
 a work of the time of Alexander Severus.

There is no doubt also that there is a great similarity between the two,
 in the attitude and inclination of the body, the position of the feet,
 the style of dress, and even the lines of the folds.
 But portrait-statues of bronze may belong to any age; because, while the
 sculptor in marble is obliged to produce a work of his own hands and conception
, and the date of a marble can therefore be determined by comparison with
 other well-known works, the caster in bronze can easily reproduce specimens
 of earlier and better times by taking a mould from a good original, altering
 the features slightly, and then casting it in excellent bronze.
 This seems to be the case with this celebrated image.
 I know that the current opinion makes it contemporary with the erection
 of Constantine's basilica; but to this I cannot subscribe on account of
 the comparatively modern shape of the keys.
 One of two things must be true, — either that these keys are a comparatively
 recent addition, in which case the statue may be a work of the fourth century,
 or they were cast together with the figure.
 If the latter be the fact the statue is of a comparatively recent age.
 Doubts on the subject might be dispelled by a careful examination of these
 crucial details, which I have not been able to undertake to my satisfaction.

The destruction of old S.
 Peter's is one of the saddest events in the history of the ruin of Rome.
 It was done at two periods and in two sections, a cross wall being raised
 in the mean time in the middle of the church to allow divine service to
 proceed without interruption, while the destruction and the rebuilding
 of each half was accomplished in successive stages.

The work began April 18, 1506, under Julius II.
 It took exactly one century to finish the western section, from the partition
 wall to the apse.
 The demolition of the eastern section began February 21, 1606.
 Nine years later, on Palm Sunday, April 12, 1615, the jubilant multitudes
 witnessed the disappearance of the partition wall, and beheld for the first

It seems that Paul V., Borghese, to whom the completion of the great work
 is due, could not help feeling a pang of remorse in wiping out forever
 the remains of the Constantinian basilica.
 He wanted the sacred college to share the responsibility for the deed,
 and summoned a consistory for September 26, 1605, to lay the case before
 the cardinals.
 The report revealed a remarkable state of things.
 It seems that while the foundations of the right side of the church built
 by Constantine had firmly withstood the weight and strain imposed upon
 them, the foundation of the left side, that is, the three walls of the
 circus of Caligula, which had been built for a different purpose, had yielded
 to the pressure so that the whole church, with its four rows of columns,
 was bending sideways from right to left, to the extent of three feet seven
 inches.
\begin_inset Marginal

\end_layout

\end_inset

 The report states that the frescoes of the left wall were covered with
 a thick layer of dust; it also stated that the ends of the great beams
 supporting the roof were all rotten and no longer capable of bearing their
 burden.
 Then cardinal Cosentino, the dean of the chapter, rose to say that, only
 a few days before, while mass was being said at the altar of S.
 Maria della Colonna, a heavy stone had fallen from the window above, and
 scattered the congregation.
 The vote of the sacred college was a foregone conclusion.
 The sentence of death was passed upon the last remains of old S.
 Peter's; a committee of eight cardinals was appointed to preside over the
 new building, and nine architects were invited to compete for the design.
 These were Giovanni and Domenico Fontana, Flaminio Ponzio, Carlo Maderno,
 Geronimo Rainaldi, Nicola Braconi da Como, Ottavio Turiano, Giovanni Antonio
 Dosio, and Ludovico Cigoli.
 The competition was won by Carlo Maderno, much to the regret of the Pope,
 who was manifestly in favor of his own architect, Flaminio Ponzio.
 The execution of the work was marked by an extraordinary accident.
 On Friday, August 27, 1610, a cloud-burst swept the city with such violence
 that the volume of water which accumulated on the terrace above the basilica,
 finding no outlet but the winding staircases which pierced the thickness
 of the walls, rushed down into the nave in roaring torrents and inundated
 it to a depth of several inches.

 marbles; the bodies of Popes were wrapped in rich robes, and wore the

 Innocent VIII., Giovanni Battista Cibo (1484--1492), was folded in an embroidere

 slippers of Turkish make, and a ring with a large emerald.
 Callixtus III.
 and Alexander VI., both of the Borgia family, have been twice disturbed
 in their common grave: the first time by Sixtus V., when he removed the
 obelisk from the spina of the circus to the piazza; the second by Paul
 V.

Grimaldi asserts that Michelangelo's plan of a Greek cross had not only
 been designed on paper, but actually begun.
 When Pope Borghese and Carlo Maderno determined upon the Latin cross, not

 design, but the front itself, with its coating of travertine, had been
 built to the height of several feet.

 of the same year, a marvellous feat to have accomplished.
 The dome itself was begun five days later, and finished in seventeen months.
 If we remember that the experts of the age had estimated ten years as the
 time required to accomplish the work, and one million gold scudi as the
 cost, we wonder at the power of will of Sixtus V., who did it in two years

 He foresaw that the political persecution from the crown of Spain and the
 daily assaults, almost brutal in their nature, which he had to endure from
 count d'Olivare, the Spanish ambassador, would shorten his days, and consequent
ly manifested but one desire: that the dome and the other great works undertaken
 for the embellishment and sanitation of the city should be finished before
 his death.
 Six hundred skilled craftsmen were enlisted to push the work of the dome
 night and day; they were excused from attending divine service on feast
 days, Sundays excepted.
 We may form an idea of the haste felt by all concerned in the enterprise,
 and of their determination to sacrifice all other interests to speed, by
 the following anecdote.
 The masons, being once in need of another receptacle for water, laid their
 hands on the tomb of Pope Urban VI., dragged the marble sarcophagus under
 the dome on the edge of a lime-pit, and emptied it of its contents.
 The golden ring was given to Giacomo della Porta, the architect, the bones
 were put aside in a corner of the building, and the coffin was used as
 a tank from 1588 to 1615.

It is easy to imagine to what surprising effect of light and shade such
 vastness of proportion lends itself on the occasion of illuminations.

 It has not been seen since 1870.
 I have heard from old friends who remember the illumination of the interior,

Before leaving the Vatican let me answer a doubt which may naturally have
 occurred to the mind of the reader, as it has long perplexed the author.
 After the many vicissitudes to which the place has been subject, from the
 time of Elagabalus to the pillage of the constable de Bourbon, can we be
 sure that the body of the founder of the Roman Church is still lying in
 its grave under the great dome of Michelangelo, under the canopy of Urban
 VIII., under the high altar of Clement VIII.? After considering the case
 from its various aspects, and weighing all the circumstances which have
 attended each of the barbaric invasions, I cannot see any reason why we
 should disbelieve the popular opinion.
 The tombs of S.
 Peter and S.
 Paul have been exposed but once to imminent danger, and that happened in
 846, when the Saracens took possession of their respective churches and
 plundered them at leisure.
 Suppose the crusaders had taken possession of Mecca: their first impulse
 would have been to wipe the tomb of the Prophet from the face of the earth,
 unless the keepers of the Kaabah, warned of their approach, had time to
 conceal or protect the grave by one means or another.
 Unfortunately, we know very little about the Saracenic invasion of 846;
 still it seems certain that Pope Sergius II.
 and the Romans were warned days or weeks beforehand of the landing of the
 infidels, by a despatch from the island of Corsica.
 Inasmuch as the churches of S.
 Peter and S.
 Paul were absolutely defenceless, in their outlying positions, I am sure
 that steps were taken to conceal or wall in the entrance to the crypts
 and the crypts themselves, unless the tombs were removed bodily to shelter
 within the city walls.
 An argument, very little known but of great value, seems to prove that
 the relics were saved.

 If this precious object is there, the remains must a fortiori be there
 also.
 Here comes the decisive test.
 In the spring of 1594, while Giacomo della Porta was levelling the floor
 of the church above the Confession, removing at the same time the foundations
 of the Ciborium of Julius II., the ground gave way, and he saw through the
 opening what nobody had beheld since the time of Sergius II., — the grave
 of S.
 Peter, — and upon it the golden cross of Constantine.
 On hearing of the discovery, Pope Clement VIII., accompanied by cardinals
 Bellarmino, Antoniano, and Sfrondato, descended to the Confession, and
 with the help of a torch, which Giacomo della Porta had lowered into the
 hollow space below, could see with his own eyes and could show to his followers
 the cross, inscribed with the names of Constantine and Helena.

Wonder has been manifested at the behavior of Constantine towards S.
 Paul, whose basilica at the second milestone of the Via Ostiensis appears
 like a pigmy structure in comparison to that of S.
 Peter.
 Constantine had no intention of placing S.
 Paul in an inferior rank, or of showing less honor to his memory.
 He was compelled by local circumstances to raise a much smaller building
 to this apostle.
 As before stated, there were three rules which builders of sacred memorial
 edifices had to observe: first, that the tomb-altar of the saint in whose
 honor the building was to be erected should not be molested or moved from
 its original place either vertically or horizontally; second, that the
 edifice should be adapted to the tomb so as to give it a place of honor
 in the centre of the apse; third, that the apse and the front of the edifice
 should look towards the east.
 The position of S.
 Peter's tomb in relation to the circus of Nero and the cliffs of the Vatican
 was such as to give the builders of the basilica perfect freedom to extend
 it in all directions, especially lengthwise.
 This was not the case with that of S.
 Paul, which was only a hundred feet

 To fulfill this project, without disturbing either the grave of the apostle

In course of time the basilica became the centre of a considerable group
 of buildings, especially of monasteries and convents.
 There were also chapels, baths, fountains, hostelries, porticoes, cemeteries,
 orchards, farmhouses, stables, and mills.
 This small suburban city was exposed to a constant danger of pillage, on
 account of its location on the high-road from the coast.
 In 846 it was ransacked by the Saracens, before the Romans could come to
 the rescue.
 For these considerations, Pope John VIII.
 (872--882) determined to put the church of S.
 Paul and its surroundings under shelter, and to raise a fort that could
 also command the approach to Rome from this most dangerous side.

The construction of Johannipolis, by which the history of the classical
 and early mediaeval fortifications of Rome is brought to a close, is described
 by one document only: an inscription above the gate of the castle, which
 was copied first by Cola di Rienzo, and later by Pietro Sabino, professor
 of rhetoric in the Roman archigymnasium (Sapienza), towards the end of
 the fifteenth century.
 A few fragments of this remarkable document are still preserved in the
 cloister of the monastery.
 It states that Pope John VIII.
 raised a wall for the defence of the basilica of S.
 Paul's and the surrounding churches, convents, and hospices, in imitation
 of that built by Leo IV.

 The determination to fortify the sacred buildings at the second milestone
 of the Via Ostiensis was taken, as I have just said, in consequence of
 the inroads of the Saracens, which, under the pontificate of John, had
 become so frequent.
 The atrocities which marked their second landing on the Roman coast were
 so appalling that the whole of Europe was shaken with terror.
 Having failed in his attempt to secure help from Charles the Bald, John
 placed himself at the head of such scanty forces as he could gather from
 land and sea, under the pressure of events.
 Ships from several harbors in the Mediterranean met in the roads of Ostia;
 and on hearing that the hostile fleet had sailed from the bay of Naples,
 the Pope set sail at once.
 The gallant little squadron confronted the infidels under the cliffs of
 Cape Circeo, and inflicted upon them such a bloody defeat that the danger
 was averted, at least for a time.

 on the south side runs on the same line with John's defences, and rests
 on their foundations.

 edifices, from which there was hope of a booty; they may have profaned
 churches and oratories erected over the tombs of martyrs; but the wholesale
 destruction, the obliteration of classical and mediaeval monuments, is
 the work of the Romans and of their successive rulers.

 the day on which the Romans used to celebrate the Robigalia.
 The Christian litany and the pagan ceremony had the same purpose, that
 of securing the blessing of Heaven upon the fields, and averting from them
 the pernicious effects of late spring frosts.
 The rites were nearly the same, the principal one being a procession which
 left Rome by the Porta Flaminia, and passed across the Ponte Milvio to
 a suburban sanctuary.
 The end of the pagan pilgrimage was a temple of the god Robigus or the
 goddess Robigo, situated at the fifth milestone of the Via Claudia; that
 of the Christian the monumental cross near the same road, and ultimately
 the basilica of S.
 Peter's.
 In course of time the oratory and cross lost their genuine meaning; they
 were thought the mark the spot on which the miraculous vision had appeared
 to Constantine on the eve of the battle.
 This was not the case, however, because Eusebius, to whom the emperor himself
 described the event, says that the luminous sign appeared to him before
 the commencement of military operations, which means before he crossed
 the Alps and took possession of Susa, Turin, and Vercelli.
 But, if the heavenly apparition of the
