 the curiosities of the three principal basilicas of Rome, — the Lateran,
 the Vatican, and the Ostiensis (S.
 Paul's), — were collections of portrait heads of the Popes, which were
 painted above the colonnade on the three sides of the nave.
 In S.
 Peter's there were two sets, one on the frieze, above the capitals of the
 columns, the other on the walls of the nave, above the cornice; the first
 is marked with the letters

of Nicholas III.
 (1277--1280).
 Since his time the basilica has been burned to the ground twice — in 1308
 and 1360 — and restored three times.
 Its last disfigurement, by Innocent X.
 and Borromini in 1644, concealed whatever was left standing of the old
 building, and made it impossible for us to study its iconic pictures, if
 there were any still existing.
 We possess better information in regard to S.
 Peter's, thanks to Grimaldi, who described and copied both series of medallions
 before their destruction by Paul V in 1607.
 The lower series, which was painted by order of Nicholas III., began with
 Pope Pius I.
 (142--157) and ended with Anastasius (397--401).
 Grimaldi remarks that the Popes of the times of the persecutions, from
 Pius to Sylvester, were bareheaded; those of a later age wore the tiara;
 all had the round halo, or nimbus, except Tiberius (352--366), who had
 a square one.
 This last particular would prove that the portraits were originally painted
 in the time of Tiberius, because the square nimbus is the symbol of living
 persons.
 The upper series above the cornice was the more important of the two, on
 account of the chronological inscriptions which accompanied and explained
 each medallion.
 These inscriptions, which were too small and faint to be read with the
 naked eye from below, were not copied before their destruction.
 Grimaldi could decipher but a few:

This statement is not correct.
 The original medallions were painted on each side of the nave, and on the
 cross or end wall above the entrances.
 Those of the end wall disappeared long since, on the occasion of some repairs
 to this part of the basilica.
 Those of the left side perished in the fire of 1823; but those of the right
 side, beginning with S.
 Peter and ending with Innocent (401--417), were saved.
 They have since been detached from the wall, transferred first to canvas,
 then to stone, and are now exhibited in one of the corridors of the monastery.

 As regards those which perished in the fire, they had already been copied,
 first in the seventeenth century by order of Cardinal Francesco Barberini,
 and again in 1751 by Marangoni.
 The new series in mosaic is therefore not all fanciful and imaginary, but
 follows the tradition of the likenesses as they were first produced in
 the fifth century.
 At that time the study of the pontifical succession was receiving considerable
 attention in Rome.
 There were written catalogues inserted in liturgical books, which were
 read to the congregation on certain days of the year, so that everybody
 could argue on the subject, and remember the order of succession of the
 bishops.
 To impress this more forcibly on the minds of the people, it was written
 on the walls of the newly erected basilica of S.
 Paul, and illustrated with portraits.
 The series must have struck the imagination of visitors and pilgrims.
 The idea of apostolic inheritance, of uninterrupted hierarchy, of the supremacy
 of the See of Rome, took a definite shape in the array of these busts of
 bishops, led by S.
 Peter, and congregated, as it were, around the grave of S.
 Paul.

 This statement may be correct in a general way, especially in regard to
 the Middle Ages, but is subject to important exceptions.
 There is no doubt, for instance, that the likenesses of SS.
 Peter and Paul have been carefully preserved in Rome ever since their lifetime,
 and that they were familiar to everyone, even to school-children.
 These portraits have come down to us by scores.
 They are painted in the cubiculi of the catacombs, engraved in gold leaf

 Peter's face is full and strong, with short curly hair and beard, while
 S.
 Paul appears more wiry and thin, slightly bald, with a long pointed beard.
 The antiquity and the genuineness of both types cannot be doubted.
 After the peace of Constantine, when Sylvester, Mark, Damasus, Siricius,
 and Symmachus began to fill the city with their churches and memorial buildings
, and as the habit of exhibiting in each of them portraits of the founders
 became general, it is evident that the author of the collection of portraits
 in S.
 Paul's, which dates from the fifth century, must have had plenty of authentic
 originals at his disposal.

\begin_layout Standard
Next to these portraits, in the power of exciting the imagination and appealing
 to the sentiments of visitors and pilgrims, come the tombs of the Popes.
 I place them next to the images, because the tombs were of the most simple
 and modest character, and marked only by a name, or by an inscription which
 a few could read and decipher.
 But to us, passionate students of history and art, those graves are invaluable;
 they mark the various stages of the decline and fall of the great city
 from year to year, as well as of her glorious resurrection; they chronicle
 the leading events which have agitated Rome, Italy, and the world for the
 last sixteen centuries.
 To be sure, there are considerable breaks in the chain, due to the destruction
 of old S.
 Peter's, which contained eighty-seven graves; but the descriptions of Pietro
 Mallio, of Maffeo Vegio, and of Pietro Sabino, and the drawings of Grimaldi
 and Ciampini, help us to fill the gaps.

 If any of our younger colleagues are willing and prepared to go over the
 work in a critical spirit, let them divide the subject into three periods.

 314, the bishops of Rome were interred in the depths of the suburban cemeteries
, and their loculi marked with a simple name.
 During the second period, which begins with the peace of Constantine and
 ends with the destruction of the Vatican basilica in 1506--1606, the pontifical
 graves were mostly ancient sarcophagi or bathing basins from the

, accompanied by an inscription in verse, and, as the Renaissance was approached
, by canopies of Gothic or Romanesque style.
 In the third period, which ends with our time, the new church of S.
 Peter is transformed into a papal mausoleum which is worthy of being compared
 in refinement of art, in splendor of decoration, in richness of material,
 in historical interest, with the Pantheons of ancient Rome.
 I shall select from each of the three periods a few representative specimens.

Excited by a discovery the capital importance of which he was able to foresee
 at once, he asked an audience of the Pope, Pius IX., and begged him to purchase
 the Vigna Molinari, and grant the funds necessary to discover the crypt
 to which this fragment of a tombstone belonged.
 After listening quietly to the arguments by which the young man was advocating
 his cause, the Pope answered only four disheartening words:

 To judge of the importance of the discovery we must remember that the identific

 depended mostly upon the identification of this one.
 The

The emperor Decius gave judgment in the case of Cornelius: that he should

, and asked to perform an act of adoration: in case of a refusal that he
 should be beheaded.
 This was accordingly done, and Cornelius gave his life for his faith.
 Lucina, a noble matron, assisted by members of the clergy, collected his
 remains and buried them in a crypt on her own estate near the Cemetery
 of Callixtus, on the Appian Way; and this happened on September 14 (

 253).
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 As the Cemetery of Callixtus was the recognized burial-place of the bishops
 of Rome, why was this exception made to the rule? The reason is evident:
 the estate of Lucina contained the family vault of the Cornelii, or at
 least of a branch of the Cornelian race.
 The victim of the persecution of Decius was the first Pope of noble and
 ancient lineage.
 Apparently his relatives wished to emphasize this fact in the place selected
 for his burial, and by proclaiming his illustrious descent on his gravestone
 through the use of the old and simple language of the republic, —

 The use of Latin at this age constitutes another conspicuous exception
 to the rule, because the Greek language was not only fashionable in the

 From the time of Sylvester (314--335) to that of Leo the Great (440--461)
 they still sought the proximity of martyrs, and obeyed the rule which forbade
 burial within the walls of the city.

Sergius I.

 But other graves had crowded the placed so that it was almost impossible
 to single them out, and read their epitaphs.
 Sergius therefore ordered the body of his predecessor to be removed to
 an oratory, or chapel, in the south transept of the church, and to be enclosed
 in a beautiful monument which he adorned with costly marbles, and with
 mosaics representing prophets and saints.
 The monument was destroyed by Paul V on Saturday, May 26, 1607.

The remains of Gregory the Great have also been moved several times.
 His tombstone must have been worn by the feet of pilgrims, as only eighteen
 letters out of many hundred have been preserved to our time.
 These were discovered not many years ago, in a dark corner of the Grotte
 Vaticane.
 Two centuries after his death, his successor, Gregory IV.
 (827--844), carried his remains inside the church, to an oratory near the
 new sacristy, covered the tomb with panels of silver, and the back wall
 with golden mosaics.
 The body remained in this second place until the pontificate of Enea Silvio
 Piccolomini, Pius II.

 Andrew the apostle, removed Gregory's coffin to the new altar.

 No better or greater subject could be found than this period when the city,
 abandoned by the Byzantine emperors, harassed, besieged, starved by the
 Lombards, found in her bishops her only chance of salvation.
 They never appear to greater advantage than in those eventful times, when
 Rome was sinking so low within, when her surroundings were changed into
 a lifeless desert.

 When Alboin overran the peninsula in 568, at the head of his Lombards,
 with whom warriors of several of the races, especially Saxons, were intermixed,

On the death of Pope John III.
 in 573, Rome was so closely pressed that it was impossible to send to Constanti
nople for the confirmation of Benedict I., who had been elected his successor,
 and the papal throne remained vacant for one year.
 The same appears to have been the case on the death of Benedict, in 578,
 when Rome was held in siege by Zoto, duke of Beneventum, for the Lombard
 power had been distributed among thirty-six duchies.
 The particulars of this siege are unknown, but it probably lasted two or
 three years.
 On withdrawing from Rome Zoto took and plundered the Benedictine convent
 on Montecassino.
 The monks retired to Rome and established themselves in a convent near
 the Lateran, which they named after S.
 John Baptist, whence the basilica of Constantine or the Savior subsequently
 took its name.

 The misery of the Romans was aggravated by some natural calamities.
 Towards the end of 589, several temples and other monuments were destroyed
 by the flooding of the Tiber, and the city was afterwards afflicted by
 a devastating pestilence.

 Without citing the examples of Mont Saint Michel on the coast of Normandy,

It is remarkable that Gregory could think of the spiritual mission of the
 church in times so troubled, when the last hour of Rome and the civilized
 world seemed to have come.
 He saw that neither the condition of the world nor that of the Church was
 hopeless, and his ability, assisted by political circumstances, gave promise
 of more prosperous times.
 A great part of Europe accepted the Christian faith during his pontificate.
 Theolinda, queen of the Lombards, after the death of her husband Autharic,
 in 590, contributed greatly to the spreading of the gospel among her own
 people.
 The west Goths of Spain were converted through Reccared, their king.
 We need not repeat here the well-known story of the manner in which Gregory's
 sympathy for the Anglo-Saxon race was excited by seeing one of them in

 From the hill beyond us the generals who led the Roman armies to the conquest
 of the world took their departure; from this modest monastery went a handful
 of humble missionaries who were to preach the gospel and to bring civilization
 into countries far beyond the boundary line of the Roman empire.
 Of their success in the British Islands we have monumental evidence everywhere
 in Rome.
 Here in the vestibule of this very church is engraved the name of Sir Edward
 Carne, one of the Commissioners sent by Henry VIII.
 to obtain the opinion of foreign universities respecting his divorce from
 Catherine of Aragon; and, not far from it, that of Robert Pecham, who died
 in 1567, an exile for his faith, and left his substance to the poor.

 In the vestibule of S.

 It is doubtful whether king Ina, who succeeded Ceadwalla, and his queen,
 Aethelburga, were buried in the same place, or in the Anglo-Saxon quarter
 by the church of S.

 It is certain, however, that at a later time king Burrhed of Mercia was

 led by the Crescenzi, and the party of the Saxon emperors, represented
 by Popes Benedict VI.
 and VII.
 The Crescenzio mentioned in the epitaph of Benedict VII.
 was the son of John and Theodora, and one of the most active members of
 a family which has thrice attempted to reëstablish the republic of ancient
 Rome and shake off the yoke of German oppression.
 This one is known as Crescentius de Theodora, from the name of his mother;
 and also as Crescentius de Caballo, from his residence on the Quirinal,
 near the colossal statues of Castor and Pollux, which have given to the
 hill its modern name of Monte Cavallo.
 The Castel S.
 Angelo was the stronghold of the family.
 Under the shelter of its massive ramparts they were able to dictate the
 law to the Popes, and commit bloodshed and sacrilege with impunity.
 In 928 Marozia and her second husband Guido, marquis of Tuscany, with 
\begin_inset Marginal

\end_inset

their partisans, fell on Pope John X., who was staying in the Lateran Palace,
 murdered his brother Pietro before his eyes, and dragged him through the
 streets of Rome to the castle.
 The unfortunate Pope lingered awhile in a dark dungeon, and was ultimately
 killed by suffocation.
 Marozia, perhaps to dispel the suspicions of a violent death, allowed him
 to be buried with due honors near the middle door of the Lateran, at the
 foot of the nave.
 His grave-stone was seen and described by Johannes Diaconus, but has long
 since disappeared.
 In 974 Crescenzio, son of Theodora, committed another sacrilegious murder,
 that of Benedict VI.
 Helped by a deacon named Franco he confined him in the same dungeon of
 Castel S.
 Angelo, while Franco placed himself on the chair of S.
 Peter, under the name of Boniface VII.
 The legal Pope was soon after strangled.
 Such crimes startled for a moment the apathy of the Romans, who besieged
 and stormed the castle, deposed the usurper, and named in his place Benedict
 VII., whose grave we are now visiting in S.
 Croce in Gerusalemme.
 Yet Crescenzio and Franco did not pay dearly for their crimes.
 Franco, after plundering the Vatican basilica of its valuables, migrated
 to Constantinople, a rich and free man.
 Crescenzio died peacefully in the monastery of S.
 Alessio on the Aventine in the year 984.
 His tomb, the tomb of a murderer, whose hands had been stained with the
 blood of a Pope, was allowed the honor of a laudatory inscription.
 It can still be seen in the cloisters of the monastery:

The church of S.
 Croce has seen another strange death of a Pope, — that of Sylvester II.

 A legend, related first by cardinal Benno in 1099, describes him as deep
 in necromantic knowledge, which he had gathered during a journey through
 the Hispano-Arabic provinces.
 He is said to have carried in his travels a sort of diabolical oracle,
 a brazen head which uttered prophetic answers.
 After his election, in 999, he inquired how long he should remain in power;
 the response was

 The prophecy was soon fulfilled.
 He expired in great agony on Quadragesima Sunday, 1003, while celebrating
 mass in this church, the classic name of which he seems not to have known.
 The legend asserts that his sins were pardoned by God, and that he was
 given an honorable burial in the church of S.
 John Lateran.
 A mysterious influence, however, hung over his grave.
 Whenever one of his

 The statue was seen by Winckelmann in the Verospi palace, but I have not
 been able to ascertain its present location.
 In these same cloisters are some delightful figures of saints, in high
 relief, from an old ciborium.
 One of them, representing S.
 John the Baptist, is obviously modelled on the type of an Antinous, with
 the same abundance of curly hair, the same profile and characteristic eyebrows.
 In October, 1886, I actually saw a mediaeval stonecutter's shop, in which
 the place of honor was given to a statue of Antinous.
 The fact is so remarkable for an age in which statues were sought, not
 as models, but as material for the limekiln, that I beg leave to describe
 it.

A statue of Antinous, the favorite of Hadrian, deified after his death and

are slight, and confined to the nose and hands.
 A patient study of this figure has enabled me to reconstruct its story.
 First of all, we are sure that, from the knees down, the statue had been
 immersed in a stream of water for a very long period, because the surface
 of the marble is corroded and full of small holes, caused by the action
 of running water.
 It also bears visible traces of having been incrusted when taken out of
 the stream.
 These facts concur to prove that the Antinous, having been thrown into
 the water, or having fallen in by accident, was found or bought after the
 lapse of centuries, by our stonecutter.
 An attempt was then made to clean the statue, and, with the intention of
 preserving it as a work of art and a model, it was placed in the best room
 of the workshop.
 Both were buried for a second time, to be brought to light again in 1886.
 The statue can now be seen in the vestibule of the Banca Nazionale.

Innocent VIII., Giovanni Battista Cibo, of Genoa, is represented on his sarcophag
us sleeping the sleep of the just, while above it he appears again in the
 full power of life, seated on the pontifical throne, with the right hand
 raised in the act of blessing the multitude, and the left holding the lance
 with which Longinus had pierced the side of the Savior on the cross.
 This holy relic was a gift from the infidels, who had just taken possession
 of the capital of the Greek empire, and had raised the crescent on the
 pinnacles of S.
 Sophia.
 It seems that while Bayazid II.
 was besieging Broussa, his rebellious brother Zem or Zizim, who had already
 been defeated in the battle of June 20, 1481, succeeded in making his escape
 to Egypt, and ultimately to the island of Rhodes.
 The grand master of the Knights of S.
 John, d'Aubusson, received him cordially and sent him first to France,
 and later to Rome.
 Here he was received with royal honors; he rode through the streets on
 a charger, escorted by Francesco Cibo, a relative of the Pope, and count
 d'Aubusson, brother of the grand master.
 He is described as a man fond of sight-seeing, about forty years old, of
 a fierce and cruel countenance, tall, erect, well proportioned, with shaggy
 eyebrows, and aquiline nose.
 His brother Bayazid, fearing that he might be induced to try another rebellion
 with the help of the knights, the Pope, and the Venetians, treated him
 generously with a yearly allowance of forty thousand scudi; and secured
 the good grace of Innocent VIII.
 with the present of the holy lance.

While I was performing this duty [of keeping guard on the ramparts] some
 of the cardinals who were in the castle used to come up to see me, and
 most of all cardinal Ravenna and cardinal de' Gaddi, to whom I often said
 that I wished they would not come any more, because their red caps could
 be seen a long way off, and made it mighty dangerous for both them and
 me from those palaces which were near by, like the Torre de' Bini; so that,
 finally, I shut them out altogether, and gained thereby their ill-will
 quite decidedly.
 Signor Orazio Baglioni, who was my very good friend, also used to come
 and chat with me.
 While he was talking with me one day, he noticed a kind of a demonstration
 in a certain tavern, which was outside the Porta di Castello, at a place
 called Baccanello.
 This tavern had for a sign a red sun, painted between two windows.
 The windows being closed, Signor Orazio guessed that just behind the sun
 between them, there was a company of soldiers having a good time.
 So he said to me, `Benvenuto, if you had a mind to fire your cannon near
 that sun, I believe you would do a good piece of work, because there is
 a good deal of noise there, and they must be men of importance.' I replied
 to the gentleman, `It is enough for me to see that sun to be able to fire
 into the middle of it; but if I do, the noise of the gun and the shock
 it will make will knock over that barrel of stones which is standing near
 its mouth.' To which the gentleman answered, `Don't wait to talk about it,
 Benvenuto, for, in the first place, in the way in which the barrel is standing,
 the shock of the cannon could not knock it over; but even if it did, and
 the Pope himself were under it, it would not be as bad as you think; so
 shoot, shoot!' So I, thinking no more about it, fired right into the middle
 of the sun, exactly as I had promised I would.
 The barrel fell, just as I said, and struck the ground between

Pietro Bracci, the artist of the monument of Benedict XIV, by pushing mannerism
 to the extreme point, caused a wholesome reaction in art.
 The tomb of Clement XIII., Carlo Rezzonico of Venice (1758--1769), was intrusted
 to Canova.
 There is the difference of a few years only between the two, but it seems
 as if there were centuries.
 This monument, which marks a prodigious reaction towards the pure ideals
 of classical art, was uncovered on April 4, 1795, before an immense assembly
 of people.
 The whole of Rome was there, and the defeat of the partisans of Bernini's
 style could not have been more complete.

Disguised in ecclesiastical robes, Canova mixed with the crowd, and was

The tomb is also historically interesting.
 It was under Clement XIII that the order of the Jesuits was tried before
 the tribunal of Europe.
 The kingdom of Portugal, where they had made their first advance towards
 greatness and fame, was the first to attack them.
 The marquess of Pombal, prime minister of Joseph I, taking advantage of
 the uneasiness caused by the earthquake of 1755 and by a murderous attempt
 against the king, expelled the order from the country and the colonies
 (January 9 - September 3, 1759).
 One hundred and twenty-four were put in irons; one, named Malagrida, executed;
 thirty-seven allowed to die in prison; and the rest were embarked on seven
 ships and transported to foreign lands.
 Charles III.
 of Spain, and his minister, count d'Aranda, followed the example of Portugal.
 The Jesuits were banished from Spain, February 28, 1767; and in the night
 between April 2 and 3, they were put, five thousand in number, on transport
 vessels, and sent to Rome.
 King Louis XV and the duc de Choiseul used the same process in France.

 for punishment, and the order was banished in 1764.
 King Ferdinand IV of Naples, the grand master of Malta, the duke of Parma,
 and other potentates took their share also in the crusade.
 Whatever may be the sentiment which we personally feel towards this brotherhood
, the figures of Lorenzo Ricci, the general who so bravely contested every
 inch of the battlefield, and of Clement XIII, who died before signing the
 decree of suppression so loudly demanded by Portugal, Spain, France, Parma,
 Naples and Malta, will always be remembered with respect.
 The pressure brought on the old Pope by half the kingdoms of Europe, was
 not merely that of diplomacy.
 He was deprived of Avignon and the comté Venoisin in France, of Benevento
 in southern Italy; but to no purpose.
 The decree suppressing the order was only signed by his successor Clement
 XIV, Ganganelli, on July 21, 1773.
 Lorenzo Ricci died the following year, a state prisoner in the castle of
 S.
 Angelo.
